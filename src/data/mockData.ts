So the output will be 1.\n\n```\n**Follow-up :** ```\n Try to do it in O(1) space without using recursion.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format :** ```\nThe first line contains an Integer 'T' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains the elements of the tree in the level order form separated by a single space.\nIf any node does not have a left or right child, take -1 in its place. Refer to the example below.\nThe second line of each test case contains a single integer ‘K’, denoting ‘K’ as explained in the problem statement.\n\n```\n**Example :** ```\nElements are in the level order form. The input consists of values of nodes separated by a single space in a single line. In case a node is null, we take -1 in its place.\nFor example, the input for the tree depicted in the below image would be :\n\n```\n\n![](https://files.codingninjas.in/tree-10999.png)\n```\n1\n2 3\n4 -1 5 6\n-1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1\n-1 -1\nExplanation :\nLevel 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 1\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 1 = 2\nRight child of 1 = 3\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 4\nRight child of 2 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 3 = 5\nRight child of 3 = 6\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 4 = null (-1)\nRight child of 4 = 7\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 6 = null (-1)\nRight child of 6 = null (-1)\nLevel 5 :\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\nThe first not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level. The second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null (-1).\nNote: The above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space. Hence, for the above-depicted tree, the input will be given as:\n1 2 3 4 -1 5 6 -1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n\n```\n**Output Format :** ```\nFor each test case, print a single integer value representing the Kth largest value of the given BST.\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou are not required to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints :** ```\n1 <= T <= 100\n1 <= N <= 5 * 10^3\n1 <= K <= N\n0 <= X <= 10^9\nWhere ‘X’ is the value at the node and ‘N’ is the no. of nodes in given BST.\nTime Limit: 1 sec.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1 :\n```\n2\n2 1 4 -1 -1 3 -1 -1 -1\n4\n2 1 7 -1 -1 3 -1 -1 4 -1 -1\n3\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1 :\n```\n1\n3\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation For Sample Input 1 :\n```\nFor First Case - Same as explained in above example.\nFor the second case - \nK is 3 and the tree is depicted by the following image then,\n\n```\n\n![Example2](https://files.codingninjas.in/9_1_example2-15824.png)\n```\nThe 3rd largest element in the given BST is 3.

You are planning to invite your Ninja friends for a delightful rice meal.\nThe town you live in has exactly ‘N’ shops selling rice. The shops are numbered from 1, 2, 3 … N, and the **i’th** shop sells rice bags that weigh exactly **i** kgs. Each shop has an unlimited supply of the bags that they sell so you don’t have to worry about that. You are also given an array ‘COST’ where COST[i] denotes the price at which the i’th shop sells one bag of rice. Note that if COST[i] is equal to -1, then it means that the i’th shop is closed and you cannot buy rice from that shop (The array ‘COST’ follows 0-based indexing).\nYou have to buy exactly ‘W’ kgs of rice, you are not willing to buy extra rice to avoid any wastage. Find the minimum cost to complete this task, if it is not possible to complete the task then print “-1”.\n**Example :** ```\nIf ‘N’ = 5, ‘W‘ = 4 and “COST’’ = {100, 5, -1, 100, 100}.\nThen, we can buy two bags of rice from the 2’nd shop. This shop sells rice in packing of 2kgs each and sells each bag for COST[1] = 5. Therefore we have to pay a total cost of 2 * 5 = 10 to complete this task.\nNote that there are more ways to complete this task. For example, we can buy four bags of rice from the 1’st shop, this will have a cost of 4 * COST[0] = 400 which is much greater than the cost of 10 calculated earlier. Therefore we will print 10.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format :** ```\nThe first line contains a single integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases, then each test case follows:\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers ‘N’ and ‘W’, denoting the number of shops and the weight of rice respectively.\nThe next lines contain N integers ‘COST’, denoting the price charged by each shop for one bag of rice.\n\n```\n**Output Format :** ```\nFor each test case, print the minimum cost to complete the task.\nOutput for each test case will be printed on a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note :** ```\nYou are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of.

There are two types of paths that connect any two states. One is the normal path, and the other is a special path. Both paths have their respective lengths. You can use either of the paths to travel between two states. Your task is to determine the shortest distance between the two given states such that at most, one(possibly zero) special path is included in this path.\n**Note:** ```\n1. All the paths are directed.\n2. Multiple paths can be present between two states.\n3. All the states are connected with each other.\n4. It does not have any self-loop.\n5. At least one path always exists between the two given states.\n\n```\n**For Example:** ```\nIf ‘N’ = 3, ‘M’ = 2, and given values of paths are \n[ [1, 2, 2, 3],\n [2, 3, 4, 2] ]\nYou have to calculate the shortest distance between ‘X’ = 1 and ‘Y’ = 3\n\n```\n\n![diagram](https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/asset_0000000000000486_1627798774_untitled-diagram-3-1-8847.png)\n```\nIn the diagram, we can observe no direct edge from state 1 to state, 3 but we can go from state 1 to state 2 using the normal path of length 2 and then from state 2 to state 3 using the special path of length 2. So the total length will be 4, and we can clearly see that no other path can be smaller than this. Hence, the answer is 4.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line contains an integer ‘T’, which denotes the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, ‘N’ and ‘M’, denoting the number of states and the number of paths, respectively.\nThe next ‘M’ lines contain four space-separated integers, ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘W1’, ‘W2’, denoting a normal path from ‘A’ to ‘B’ having a length ‘W1’ and a special path having a length ‘W2’.\nThe last line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, ‘X’ and ‘Y’, denoting the states between which the shortest distance has to be calculated.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, print an integer denoting the shortest path length between the two given states. \nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:** ```\n1 <= T <= 10\n1 <= N < 10^3\nN-1 <= M <= 10^3\n1 <= A,B,X,Y <= N\n1 <= W1,W2 <= 10^6\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1:\n```\n2\n2 1\n1 2 2 1\n1 2\n3 3\n1 2 4 3\n2 3 5 2\n1 3 2 4\n1 3 \n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1:\n```\n1\n2\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation:\n```\nFor test case 1:\nA direct path exists from state 1 to state 2. The length will be 2 when we traverse from state 1 to state 2 using the normal path, but when we traverse using the special path, the length will be 1, which is less. Hence our answer is 1.\nFor test case 2:\nA direct path exists from state 1 to state 3. The length will be 2 when we traverse from state 1 to state 3 using the normal path, but when we traverse using the special path, the length will be 4, which is more. Hence our answer is 2.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2:\n```\n1\n3 3\n1 2 3 2\n2 3 4 2\n1 3 7 8\n1 3\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2:\n```\n5\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\nint findShortestDistance(int n, vector<vector<int>> &edges, int src, int dst) {\n// Write your code here.\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

The first one points to the next node of the list, however, the other pointer is random and can point to any node of the list or null. The task is to create a deep copy of the given linked list and return its head. We will validate whether the linked list is a copy of the original linked list or not.\nA deep copy of a Linked List means we do not copy the references of the nodes of the original Linked List rather for each node in the original Linked List, a new node is created.\nFor example,\n![example](https://files.codingninjas.in/linkedlist-5722.png)\nRandom pointers are shown in red and next pointers in black.\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer ‘T’ representing the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe only line of each test case contains the elements of the linked-list with random pointers.

The rod can be cut into different sizes and each size has a cost associated with it. Determine the maximum cost obtained by cutting the rod and selling its pieces.\n**Note:** ```\n1. The sizes will range from 1 to ‘N’ and will be integers.\n2. The sum of the pieces cut should be equal to ‘N’.\n3. Consider 1-based indexing.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input format:** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases.\nThe next 2 * T lines represent the ‘T’ test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer ‘N’ denoting the length of the rod.\nThe second line of each test case contains a vector ’A’, of size ‘N’ representing the cost of different lengths, where each index of the array is the sub-length and the element at that index is the cost for that sub-length.\n\n```\n\nNote:\n```\nSince 1-based indexing is considered, the 0th index of the vector will represent sub-length 1 of the rod. Hence the (N - 1)th index would represent the cost for the length ‘N’. \n\n```\n**Output Format** ```\nFor each test case, print a single line that contains a single integer which is the maximum cost obtained by selling the pieces.\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n\n```\n\nNote:\n```\nYou do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of.

So his friend gives him an array on his birthday. The array consists of positive and negative integers. Now Ninja is interested in finding the length of the longest subarray whose sum is zero.\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. \nThe first line of each test case will contain the integer N, denoting the number of elements in the given array.\nThe second and last line contains N space-separated integers that denote the value of the elements of the array.\n\n```\n**Output Format** ```\nThe first and only line of each test case in the output contains an integer denoting the length of the longest subarray whose sum is zero.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou are not required to print the expected output; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:** ```\n1 <= T <= 10\n1 <= N <= 10^4\n-10^5 <= arr[i] <= 10^5\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1:\n```\n2 \n5\n1 3 -1 4 -4\n4\n1 -1 2 -2 \n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1:\n```\n2\n4 \n\n```\n\n##### Explanation for Sample Output 1:\n```\nIn the first test case, the given array is (1, 3, -1, 4, -4). The sub-arrays we can create are (1), (3), (-1), (4), (-4), (1, 3), (3, -1), (-1, 4), (4, -4), (1, 3, -1), (3, -1, 4), (-1, 4, -4), (1, 3, -1, 4), (3, -1, 4, -4), (1, 3, -1, 4, -4). Out of them only (4, -4) is the sub array whose sum is zero.Length of this sub array is 2 and hence we return 2 as the final answer.\nIn the second test case, the given array is (1, -1, 2, -2). The sub-arrays we can create are (1), (-1), (2), (-2), (1, -1), (-1, 2), (2, -2), (1, -1, 2), (-1, 2, -2), (1, -1, 2, -2). Out of them sub arrays with zer sum are (1, -1), (2, -2), (1, -1, 2, -2). Out of them only (1, -1, 2, -2) has the longest length of 4. Hence we return 4 as the final answer.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2:\n```\n2 \n3\n4 -5 1\n4\n1 2 1 -2\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2 :\n```\n3\n0\n\n```\n\nJavascript (node v10.20.0) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n/* Declare and implement your function here \neg: function example(parameter_name1,parameter_name2....){}\nHandle the input/output from main()\n*/\nprocess.stdin.resume();\nprocess.stdin.setEncoding('ascii');\nvar input_stdin = \"\";\nvar input_stdin_array = \"\";\nvar input_currentline = 0;\nprocess.stdin.on('data', function (data) {\ninput_stdin += data;\n});\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

You are supposed to return the reverse of the level order traversal.\n**For example:** ```\nFor the given binary tree\n\n```\n\n![Example](https://files.codingninjas.in/btree-5038.png)\n```\nThe reverse level order traversal will be {7,6,5,4,3,2,1}.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line contains elements in the level order form. The line consists of values of nodes separated by a single space. In case a node is null, we take -1 in its place.\nFor example, the input for the tree depicted in the below image would be :\n\n```\n\n![Example](https://files.codingninjas.in/btree-5038.png)\n```\n1\n2 3\n4 -1 5 6\n-1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1\n-1 -1\n\n```\n\nExplanation :\n```\nLevel 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 1\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 1 = 2\nRight child of 1 = 3\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 4\nRight child of 2 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 3 = 5\nRight child of 3 = 6\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 4 = null (-1)\nRight child of 4 = 7\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 6 = null (-1)\nRight child of 6 = null (-1)\nLevel 5 :\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\nThe first not-null node(of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level. The second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null(-1).\n\n```\n**Note :** ```\nThe above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space. Hence, for the above-depicted tree, the input will be given as:\n1 2 3 4 -1 5 6 -1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nPrint all the nodes in reverse level order traversal separated by a single space.\n\n```\n**Note :** ```\nYou do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of.

He observed that the string consists of the same adjacent letters. So, he thought to remove some characters from the string using this operation.\nIn one operation, we can delete a substring having ‘K’ same adjacent characters. causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.\nNinja applied this operation as many times as possible.\nYour task is to find the resultant string after all operations.\nYou are given a string ‘S’ having ‘N’ lowercase letters and an integer ‘K’. Find the resultant string after all the operations are done.\n**For Example** ```\nIf the given string S = “abcbaacd” and k = 2. In the first operation, we will remove ‘aa’ from the string. After that, we will concatenate the left and right strings as the resultant string will be “abcb” + “cd” = “abcbcd”.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of the input contains an integer, 'T,’ denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers, ‘N’ denoting the number of characters present in string S and ‘K’.\n\n```\n\nThe following line contains the string ‘S’.\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, print ‘an integer corresponding to the minimum number of swaps required.\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou do not need to print anything.

The resultant string will be “abcbaccd”.In the second operation, we will remove ‘cc’ from the string. The resultant string will be “abcbad”.Now, we can’t apply any operation on the string.

He has ‘N’ boxes with him numbered from ‘0’ to ‘N-1’, initially, all the boxes are empty.\nNow for the next ‘M’ days, Ravi adds one coin to each box from ‘[L, R]’, it is denoted by the 2d-array ‘ARR’. (The range ‘L’ to ‘R’ may or may not be the same for each of the ‘M’ days).\nNow Deep was very good at maths and being a friend of Ravi he challenged him to answer ‘Q’ questions, denoted by the array ‘QUERIES’ after the ‘M’ days have passed.\nEach question will have a number ‘X’ and Ravi has to find the number of boxes having at least ‘X’ coins in it. (i.e. number of boxes having more than or equal to ‘X’ coins).\nNow Ravi has found the answers to the questions but is not sure if they are completely correct, So he has asked you to calculate the answers to these questions. Can you help him?.\n**EXAMPLE :** ```\nInput: ‘N’ = 3, ‘M' = 2, ‘Q’ = 1, ‘ARR’ = [[0, 1], [0, 2]], ‘QUERIES’ = [2]\nOutput: 2\nIn this case,\nAfter Day 1 number of coins in the boxes will be: [1, 1, 0]\nAfter Day 2 number of coins in the boxes will be: [2, 2, 1]\nHence the boxes having at least ‘2’ coins are Box 0 and Box 1.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format :** ```\nThe first line will contain the integer ‘T’, the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of two lines.\nThe first line of input contains three integers, ‘N’, ‘M’, and ‘Q’ separated by spaces.\nFollowed by ‘M’ lines, each line contains two integers, ‘L’ and ‘R’.\nFollowed by ‘Q’ lines, each line contains one integer, ‘X’.\n\n```\n**Output format :** ```\nFor each test case, print ‘Q’ space separated integers denoting the answers to the ‘Q’ questions asked by Deep.\n\n```\n**Note :** ```\nYou don't need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints :** ```\n1 <= ‘T’ <= 10\n1 <= ‘N’ <= 10^5\n1 <= ‘M’ <= 10^5\n1 <= ‘Q’ <= 10^5\n0 <= ‘L’ <= ‘R’ <= ‘N-1’\n0 <= ‘X’ <= 10^5\nIt is guaranteed that sum of ‘N’ over all test cases is <= 10^5\nIt is guaranteed that sum of ‘M’ over all test cases is <= 10^5\nIt is guaranteed that sum of ‘Q’ over all test cases is <= 10^5\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1 :\n```\n2\n5 1 1\n1 4\n1\n7 3 2\n0 3\n2 6\n4 6\n0\n2\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1 :\n```\n4\n7 5\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :\n```\nFor the first test case, \nAfter Day 1 number of coins in the boxes will be: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nHence the boxes having at least ‘1’ coin are Box 1, 2, 3, and 4.\nHence, the output will be: 4\nFor the second test case,\nAfter Day 1 number of coins in the boxes will be: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nAfter Day 2 number of coins in the boxes will be: [1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1]\nAfter Day 3 number of coins in the boxes will be: [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\nAll the boxes have at least a ‘1’ coin, hence the answer to the ‘1’st question is ‘7’.\nThe boxes having at least ‘2’ coins are Box 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\nHence, the output will be: 7 5\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2 :\n```\n2\n10 3 3\n5 9\n3 7\n2 6\n3\n0\n0\n8 4 5\n0 0\n5 5\n4 4\n7 7\n2\n0\n4\n3\n0\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2 :\n```\n2 10 10 \n0 8 0 0 8\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nvector<int> getAnswers(int n, int m, int q, vector<vector<int>> &arr, vector<int> &queries) {\n// Write your code here.\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

Ninja took every child to a nearby candy shop and bought them candies. The shop contains ‘M’ types of candies with an unlimited supply of each candy. The cost of each candy is between 1 and M, inclusive and distinct.\nThe shopkeeper has marked every candy with a number between 1 and M, inclusive. To make this process fascinating, Ninja found a way. He asked every child three integers, ‘L’, ‘R’, and ‘X’. Then he bought exactly ‘X’ pieces of each candy from [L to R] , i.e., “L, L+1, L+2,..., R-1, R”.\nYour task is to find the lexicographically smallest array “A” of ‘M’ integers where each element represents the cost of the ith candy, such that the total cost spent by Ninja is minimum.\nNote:\n```\nThe cost array is a permutation of the first M natural numbers.\nThe shop has unlimited supplies of candies.\nIn case of multiple permutations, print one which is lexicographically minimum. \n\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\nLet’s say ‘N’ = 3 , ‘M’ = 5 \nThe integers told by children are { {2 , 4 , 1} ,{1 , 3 , 2} , {3, 3 , 5} } \nThe optimal permutation will be {3 2 1 4 5}  \nCosts paid by Ninja are 7, 12, and 5, respectively. \nThe total cost would be 7 + 12 + 5 = 24\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format :** ```\nFirst-line contains 'T,' denoting the number of Test cases.\nFor each Test case:\nThe first contains two integers, 'N' and ‘M’, where ‘N’ is the number of children and ‘M’ is the number of candies available in the shop.\nNext, the ‘N’ line contains three integers, ‘L’, ‘R’, and ‘X’.\n\n```\n**Output format :** ```\nFor each test case, print ‘M’ integers, i.e., the permutation of ‘M’ natural numbers.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints :** ```\n1<=‘T’<=10\n1<=‘N’<=10^5\n1<=‘M’<=10^5\n1<=‘L’<=‘R’<=‘M’\n1<=‘X’<=10^5\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1 :\n```\n2\n3 5\n2 4 1\n1 3 2\n3 3 5\n2 3\n2 3 1\n1 2 2\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1 :\n```\n3 2 1 4 5 \n2 1 3 \n\n```\n\n##### Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :\n```\nFor testcase one:\n‘N’ = 3 , ‘M’ = 5 \nThe integers told by children are { {2 , 4 , 1} ,{1 , 3 , 2} , {3, 3 , 5} }\nThe optimal permutation will be {3 2 1 4 5}\nCosts paid by Ninja are 7, 12, and 5, respectively. \nThe total cost would be 7 + 12 + 5 = 24\nFor test case two:\n‘N’ = 2 , ‘M’ = 3 \nThe integers told by children are { {2 , 3 , 1} ,{1 , 2 , 2}.\nThe optimal permutation will be {2 1 3}.\nCosts paid by Ninja are 4 and 6, respectively. \nThe total cost would be 4+6 = 10\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2 :\n```\n2\n4 6 \n2 5 2 \n1 5 1 \n3 6 3\n4 4 1   \n4 6 \n1 3 2 \n1 5 1 \n1 1 3\n2 2 1   \n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2 :\n```\n6 4 2 1 3 5 \n1 2 3 4 5 6 \n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nvector<int> birthdayTreat(vector < vector<int> > & child , int &m) {\n// Write your code here\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

This sometimes results in incorrect text being typed.\nYou are given two strings ‘Expected’ and ‘Typed’, you need to tell if the actual text was typed correctly or not. The text is typed correctly if some characters were long pressed (typed multiple times) while typing the ‘Expected’ text. Print “true” if the actual text was typed correctly, else print “false”.\n**For Example :** ```\nIf Typed = “aaabcc” and Expected = “abc”\nThen, while trying to type “abc” one might long press ‘a’ and that would result in typing three consecutive a’s. This if followed by correctly pressing ‘b’ once and in the end he might long press ‘c’ resulting in typing it twice, the resulting text typed in this case is equal to “aaabcc” and therefore we will return “true”.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format :** ```\nThe first line contains a single integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases, then each test case follows:\nThe first line of each test case contains a string ‘Expected’ that denotes the original text that was to be typed.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string ‘Typed’ that denotes the text that was actually typed.\n\n```\n**Output Format :** ```\nFor each test case, print the “true” if the text was typed correctly, else print “false”.\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note :** ```\nYou are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints :** ```\n1 ≤ T ≤ 10   \n1 ≤ |Expected| ≤ 5000\n1 ≤ |Typed| ≤ 5000\nBoth the strings consist of lowercase English alphabets \nTime limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1 :\n```\n2\nabc\naaabcc\nabcd\naaabdcc\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1 :\n```\ntrue\nfalse\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation For Sample Input 1 :\n```\nFor test case 1 :\nThe text was typed correctly because:\nWhile trying to type “abc” one might long-press ‘a’ and that would result in typing three consecutive a’s. This if followed by correctly pressing ‘b’ once and in the end one might long-press ‘c’ resulting in typing it twice, the resulting text typed in this case is equal to “aaabcc” and therefore we will return “true”.\nFor test case 2 : \nThe text was typed incorrectly because:\nWhile trying to type “abcd”, one cannot type “aaabdcc” as the faulty keyboard may cause typing a character multiple times, but it cannot cause typing the character ‘d’ of the original text before the character ‘c’, the ‘Typed’ text has ‘d’ before ‘c’, which means the text was typed incorrectly, therefore we will return “false”.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2 :\n```\n2\nabccc\naaabcc\nz\nzzzzzz\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2 :\n```\nfalse\ntrue\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nbool faultyKeyboard(string expected, string typed) {\n// Write your code here.\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

The game is not chess, and involves just one coin.\nThe coordinates of the top left cell are (1,1) and the bottom right are (15,15). The coin is initially at (x,y). In each turn, the player whose turn it is can move the coin to any of the four cells (provided they are inside the board):\n```\n(x-2,y+1)\n(x-2,y-1)\n(x+1,y-2)\n(x-1,y-2)\n\n```\n\nThe figure below shows the possible moves of a coin at (5,4) (An 8 x 8 board is given in the image, but in the problem, it will always be a 15 x 15 board).\n![](https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/asset_0000000000000573_1640933875_chessboard.png)\nAlice makes the first move. Both Alice and Bob take alternate turns and move until it is not possible to move the coin anymore. The player unable to make a move loses.\nFor example:\n```\nIf there is a coin at (1,1), Bob wins the game as Alice can make no move to start the game.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line contains 'T', denoting the number of test cases.\nFor each Test :\nThe first line contains three space-separated integers, ’X’ and ‘Y’.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each query, if Alice wins, print “First” and if Bob wins, print “Second”..\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou are not required to print the expected output.

Push(num): Push the given number in the stack.\n2. Pop: Remove and return the top element from the stack if present, else return -1.\n3. Top: return the top element of the stack if present, else return -1.\n4. getMin: Returns minimum element of the stack if present, else return -1.\n\n```\n\nFor Example:\n```\nFor the following input: \n1\n5\n1 1\n1 2\n4\n2\n3\nFor the first two operations, we will just insert 1 and then 2 into the stack which was empty earlier. So now the stack is => [2,1]\nIn the third operation, we need to return the minimum element of the stack, i.e., 1.

Now the stack is => [] (empty)\nFor the third operation, we need to return the topmost element of the stack. As the stack is empty we will return -1. Now the stack is => [] (empty)\n In the fourth operation, we return the minimum element of the stack if it is not empty, i.e. -1 as it has no elements.

Your task is to find the number of good nodes in the given binary tree.\nA good node is defined as good if there are no nodes with a value greater than X’s value in the path from the root to X.\nYou are given a root node ‘ROOT’.Your task is to return the number of good nodes.\n**Example:** ```\nElements are in the level order form. The input consists of values of nodes separated by a single space in a single line. In case a node is null, we take -1 in its place.\nFor example, the input for the tree depicted in the below image would be :\n\n```\n\n![Example](https://files.codingninjas.in/tree2-5139.png)\n```\n1\n2 3\n4 -1 5 6\n-1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1\n-1 -1\nExplanation :\nLevel 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 1\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 1 = 2\nRight child of 1 = 3\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 4\nRight child of 2 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 3 = 5\nRight child of 3 = 6\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 4 = null (-1)\nRight child of 4 = 7\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 6 = null (-1)\nRight child of 6 = null (-1)\nLevel 5 :\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\nThe first not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level. \nThe second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null (-1).\n\n```\n**Note :** ```\nThe above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space. Hence, for the above-depicted tree, the input will be given as:\n1 2 3 4 -1 5 6 -1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of the input contains an integer, 'T,’ denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains the elements of the tree in the level order form separated by a single space.

Your task is to print every path of the binary tree with the sum of nodes in the path as ‘K’.\nNote:\n```\n1. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).\n2. Output the paths in the order in which they exist in the tree from left to right. Example: In the below example, path {1,3} is followed by {3,1} and so on.\n\n```\n\nExample:\n```\nFor K = 4 and tree given below:\n\n```\n\n![alt text](https://files.codingninjas.in/untitled-diagram-10-6111.jpg)\n```\nThe possible paths are:\n1 3\n3 1\n-1 4 1\n4 \n-1 5\nThe sum of values of nodes of each of the above-mentioned paths gives a sum of 4.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input format** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases.\nThe next ‘T’ lines represent the ‘T’ test cases.\nThe first line of input contains the elements of the tree in the level order form separated by a single space.\nIf any node does not have a left or right child, take -1 in its place. Refer to the example below.\nThe second line of each test case contains an integer ‘K’ denoting the sum.\n\n```\n**Example:** ```\nElements are in the level order form. The input consists of values of nodes separated by a single space in a single line.

The second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null (-1).\n\n```\n**Note :** ```\nThe above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space. Hence, for the above-depicted tree, the input will be given as:\n1 2 3 4 -1 5 6 -1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n\n```\n**Output format:** ```\nThe output of each test case prints all the paths of the binary tree with the sum of nodes in the path as ‘K' in the order in which they exist in the tree from left to right.\nThe output of each test case is printed in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note** ```\nYou are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of.

You are given an array of points ‘points’, you are also given an integer ‘angle’ i.e. your field of view and while standing on the given you are allowed to rotate but not move. Your task is to determine the maximum number of points visible to you simultaneously.\nSuppose you rotate ‘d’ degrees counterclockwise.\n![PointDiagram](https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/asset_0000000000000563_1639271423_Point%20Diagram.drawio.png)\n**For Example:** ```\nYou are given ‘location’ = [2, 2], ‘points’ = [[3,3], [4, 2], [3, 1]], ‘angle’ = 60. Due to the field of view only two, only 2, points [[2, 4], [3, 2]] simultaneously, are visible from the given position hence the answer is 2.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of input contains a single integer ‘T’ representing the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains 2 space-separated integers, ‘N’, ‘angle’, where N represents the number of points in the given array and ‘angle’ is the given integer.\nThe second line of each test case contains two space-separated integers ‘x’ and ‘y’ representing coordinates of the location you are standing on.\nThe next ‘N’ lines of input contain two space-separated integers ‘a’ and ‘b’ representing ‘X’ and ‘Y’ coordinates of the points in the ‘points’ array.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, print a single integer representing the maximum number of points visible at a time.\nPrint a separate line in each test case.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:** ```\n1 <= T <= 10\n1 <= N <= 10^5\n0 <= angle <= 360\n0 <= x, y, a, b <= 1000\n\n```\n**Note :** ```\nYou do not need to print anything.

You are given two arrays ‘Height’ and ‘Infront‘ consisting of ‘N’ non-negative integers. ‘Height[i]’ gives the height of the ith person, and ‘Infront[i]’ gives the number of persons who are taller than the ith person and standing in front of the ith person.\nYour task is to find out the actual order of people in a queue. You should print ‘N’ integers where the ‘ith’ integer is the height of the person who should be at the ith position from the start of the queue.\nNote :\n```\n1. Consider that all elements in array ‘Height’ are unique.\n2. It is guaranteed that a valid order always exists for the given array ‘Height’ and ‘Infront’. \n\n```\n\nExample :\n```\nLet there are 6 people, their heights are given by array ‘Height’ : [5, 3, 2, 6, 1, 4], and the number of people in front of them is given by array ‘Infront’: [0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 2]\nThus the actual order of people’s height in the queue will be [5, 3, 2, 1, 6, 4]\nIn this order, the first person in a queue i.e a person with a height of 5, has no person in front of them who is taller than him.\nThe second person in a queue i.e a person with a height of 3 has 1 person (person with height 5) in front of them who is taller than him.\nThe third person in a queue i.e a person with a height of 2 has 2 people (people with height 5 and 3) in front of them who are taller than him.\nThe fourth person in a queue i.e a person with a height of 1 has 3 people (people with height 5, 3, 2) in front of them who are taller than him.\nThe fifth person in a queue i.e a person with a height of 6 has no person in front of them who is taller than him.\nThe sixth person in a queue i.e a person with a height of 4 has 2 people (people with height 5, and 6) in front of them who are taller than him.\nWe can observe this is the only possible order that is possible according to the array ‘Infront’.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input format :** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases.\nThe next 3 * 'T' lines represent the ‘T’ test cases.\nThe first line of each test case consists of a single integer ‘N’ representing the number of people in a queue.  \nThe second line of each test case consists of ‘N’ space-separated integers representing the array ‘Height’.\nThe third line of each test case consists of ‘N’ space-separated integers representing the array ‘Infront’.\n\n```\n**Output format :** ```\nFor each test case, print ‘N’ integers where the ‘ith’ integer is the height of the person who should be at the ith position from the start of the queue.\nPrint the output of each test case in a new line.\n\n```\n\nNote :\n```\nYou do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.

Only a single wall can be built between any two cells of the model that are adjacent in all four directions, on their shared boundary.\nWith every passing night, the virus spreads to all the adjacent cells, unless the cells are blocked by a wall. You need to build walls in order to stop the virus from spreading in the whole country. Note that you can only install walls around only one region which is the affected area that threatens to infect the most uninfected cells of the matrix in one day.\nGiven the state of each cell, your task is to find the number of walls you used to stop as many cells as possible from being infected.\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line contains an integer ‘T’ which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run.

Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.\nGiven a DAG consisting of ‘V’ vertices and ‘E’ edges, you need to find out any topological sorting of this DAG. Return an array of size ‘V’ representing the topological sort of the vertices of the given DAG.\nFor example, Consider the DAG shown in the picture.\n![alt tex](https://files.codingninjas.in/eg-6753.png)\nIn this graph, there are directed edges from 0 to 1 and 0 to 3, so 0 should come before 1 and 3. Also, there are directed edges from 1 to 2 and 3 to 2 so 1 and 3 should come before 2.\nSo, The topological sorting of this DAG is {0 1 3 2}.\nNote that there are multiple topological sortings possible for a DAG. For the graph given above one another topological sorting is: {0, 3, 1, 2}\n**Note:** ```\n1. It is guaranteed that the given graph is DAG.\n2. There will be no multiple edges and self-loops in the given DAG.\n3. There can be multiple correct solutions, you can find any one of them. \n4. Don’t print anything, just return an array representing the topological sort of the vertices of the given DAG.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input format:** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases. The description of ‘T’ test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers ‘V’, ‘E’, representing the number vertices and edges in the graph respectively.\nThen ‘E’ lines follow, each containing 2 space-separated integers ‘u’, ‘v’ representing that there is a directed edge from vertex ‘u’ to vertex ‘v’\n\n```\n**Output format :** ```\nFor each test case, return an array representing the topological sort of the vertices of the given DAG.\n\n```\n\nNote :\n```\nYou do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:** ```\n1 <= T <= 50\n1 <= V <= 10^4\n0 <= E <= 10^4\n0 <= u, v < V \nWhere ‘T’ is the total number of test cases, ‘V’ is the number of vertices, ‘E’ is the number of edges, and ‘u’ and ‘v’ both represent the vertex of a given graph.\nTime limit: 2 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1:\n```\n2\n2 1\n1 0\n3 2\n0 1\n0 2\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1:\n```\n1 0\n0 2 1\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation of Sample Input 1:\n```\nTest case 1:\nThe number of vertices ‘V’ = 2 and number of edges ‘E’ = 1.\nThe graph is shown in the picture: \n\n```\n\n![alt text](https://files.codingninjas.in/eg1-6752.png)\n```\nThe topological sorting of this graph should be {1, 0} as there is a directed edge from vertex 1 to vertex 0, thus 1 should come before 0 according to the given definition of topological sorting.\nTest case 2:\nThe number of vertices ‘V’ = 3 and number of edges ‘E’ = 2.\nThe graph is shown in the picture:\n\n```\n\n![alt text](https://files.codingninjas.in/eg2-6751.png)\n```\nAs there are two directed edges starting from 0, so 0 should come before 1 and 2 in topological sorting. \nThus the topological sorting of this graph should be {0, 2, 1} or {0, 1, 2}\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2:\n```\n2\n1 0\n4 4\n0 1\n0 3\n1 2\n3 2\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2:\n```\n0\n0 1 3 2\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation of Sample Input 2:\n```\nTest case 1:  \nThere is only a single vertex in the graph that is 0, so its topological sort will be {0}.\nTest case 2:\nSee problem statement for its explanation\n\n```\n\nJavascript (node v10.20.0) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n/* Declare and implement your function here \neg: function example(parameter_name1,parameter_name2....){}\nHandle the input/output from main()\n*/\nprocess.stdin.resume();\nprocess.stdin.setEncoding('ascii');\nvar input_stdin = \"\";\nvar input_stdin_array = \"\";\nvar input_currentline = 0;\nprocess.stdin.on('data', function (data) {\ninput_stdin += data;\n});\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

You start at zero, and there are ‘N’ tasks you can perform. ‘ith’ task is located at point 'Task[i][0]' in the line and requires 'Task[i][1]' time to be performed.\nTo perform the task, you need to reach the point 'Task[i][0]' and spend 'Task[i][1]' time at that location. e.g. (5,8) lies at five, so travel distance is five, and work effort is 8.\nIt takes one second to travel one unit of the path.\nNow, we are given a total of ‘totalTime’ seconds, and we need to complete as many tasks as possible and reach back to starting position.\nFind the max number of tasks that you can finish in ‘totalTime’.\nFor example:\n```\n3 tasks and 16 units of total time.\nTask = [( 2, 8 ) , ( 4, 5) , ( 5, 1)]\n( 2, 8 ) -> task 1 at position 2 in line and takes 8 sec to complete.\n( 4, 5) -> task 2 at position 4 in line and takes 5 sec to complete.\n( 5, 1) -> task 3 at position 5 in line and takes 1 sec to complete.\nSkipping the first task leaves us enough time to complete the other two tasks. Going to the location of the third task and coming back costs 2x5 =10 sec, and performing tasks at locations 4 and 5 cost us 5+1 = 6 sec. \nTotal time spent will be 10+6=16 sec.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format :** ```\nFirst-line contains 'T,' denoting the number of Test cases.\nFor each Test case:\nThe first line contains two integers, 'N' and ‘totalTime’, where ‘N’ is the number of tasks and ‘totalTime’ is the time given.\nNext, the ‘N’ lines contain two integers, ‘Task[i][0]’ and ‘Task[i][1]’, each denoting the distance of the task and the time required to complete the task.\n\n```\n**Output Format:-** ```\nAfter operating, you must return the maximum number of tasks you can finish in time ‘totalTime’.\n\n```\n**Note:-** ```\nYou don’t need to print anything.

This can be done in 2 * 2 + (3 + 4) = 11 sec.\nHence, the answer to this test case will be 11.\nFor test case two:\nTask= [ (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)]  , totalTime= 20\nIn this case, we can go to position four and complete tasks one, two, three, and four. This can be done in 2 * 4 + (1+1+1+1) = 12 sec.\nHence, the answer to this test case will be 4.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2 :\n```\n2\n3 40 \n6 5\n5 5\n3 7\n1 10\n10 1 \n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2 :\n```\n3\n0\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nint maxTasksInTheGivenBudget(vector<vector<int>>& task, int &totalTime) {\n// Write your code here.\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes, ‘u’ and ‘v’, as the lowest node in ‘T’ that has both ‘u’ and ‘v’ as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself). - Wikipedia\n![](https://files.codingninjas.in/lca-ques-13399.png)\nFor the given tree, The LCA of nodes 5 and 8 will be node 2, as node 2 is the first node that lies in the path from node 5 to root node 1 and from node 8 to root node 1.\nPath from node 5 to root node looks like 5 → 2 → 1.\nPath from node 8 to root node looks like 8 → 6 → 2 → 1.\nSince 2 is the first node that lies in both paths. Hence LCA will be 2.\nGiven any two nodes ‘u’ and ‘v’, find the LCA for the two nodes in the given Tree ‘T’.\nNote: For each test case, the tree is rooted at node 1.\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format-** ```\nThe first line contains an integer ‘T’ which denotes the number of test cases. \nFor each test case:\nThe first line contains a single integer ‘N’, denoting the number of nodes.\nEach of the following ‘N’ - 1 line contains two space-separated integers, ‘ui’ and ‘vi’, which means an edge connects these two nodes.\nThe following line will contain a single integer ‘Q’, denoting the number of queries you have to answer for the given tree. \nIn the following ‘Q’ lines, each one will have two numbers, ‘u’ and ‘v’, for which you have to find the LCA of ‘u’ and ‘v’.\n\n```\n**Output Format-** ```\nYour task is to print ‘Q’ lines for each test case. \nThe ‘Q’ lines should be the LCA of the given ‘u’ and ‘v’, respectively.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints -** ```\n1<= ‘T' <= 5 \n1 <= ‘N’ <= 10^5\n1 <= ‘Q’ <= 10^5.\n1 <= ‘u’, ‘v’ <= ‘N’.\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input-1\n```\n2\n5\n1 2\n2 3\n1 4\n2 5\n2\n3 5\n4 5\n3\n1 2\n3 2\n2\n1 3\n2 2\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output-1\n```\n2 1\n1 2\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation for Sample Input 1:\n```\nFor test case 1:\n\n```\n\n![](https://files.codingninjas.in/lca-13400.png)\n```\nFrom the above graph, \n  we can see that for nodes ‘5’ and ‘3’, ‘2’ is the direct parent of both the nodes.

Each road has a toll checkpoint, but the tax collection rules are different from the standard toll system. These checkpoints not only take money from you but give you as well.\nThe government of Ninja world fixed taxes for each checkpoint. If the tax value is positive, you have to pay that amount, and if the amount is negative, you receive that amount. For example, if tax is 3 dollars at a checkpoint, you have to pay 3 dollars at the checkpoint. If tax is -5 dollars, you receive 5 dollars from that checkpoint.\nOne of your friends, Alice, is planning a trip in the Ninja world but wants to understand taxation very well. Your task is to provide him with the minimum amount he needs to pay for each pair of cities, i.e., print a matrix of size N*N where matrix[i][j] denotes minimum tax one needs to pay to travel from city 'i' to city 'j' via some connecting roads.\nNote:-\n```\n1. Cities are numbered from [0, 1, 2 ….. N-1] in input data.\n2. To minimize the cost for a pair (i, j), any road can be travelled any number of times.\n3. For any pair (i, j), if city 'j' is not reachable from city 'i', the value of matrix[i][j] should be '-1'.\n4. If matrix[i][j] is negative for any pair, you should minimize it too, i.e., find the most negative value.\n5. For any pair (i, j), if 'j' is reachable from city 'i', but it’s impossible to minimize the cost, fill the entire answer matrix with integer '-1'.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line contains 'T', denoting the number of tests.\n For each Test :\n  The first line contains two space-separated integers, 'N' and 'M', denoting the number of cities and roads, respectively.\n  Next 'M' lines contain three integers 'x[i]', 'y[i]', 'w[i]' denoting there is a directed road from city 'x[i]' to city 'y[i]', and having tax 'w[i]'.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each Test :\n  There should be 'N' lines, each containing 'N' space-separated integers. The j-th value in i-th row denotes the minimum tax to travel from city 'i' to city 'j'.\n  If a pair of cities is unreachable, print integer -1.\n  If a pair is reachable but cannot minimize cost, all elements in the matrix must be -1.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou are not required to print the expected output.

Hence, the answer is ‘-1’.\nFor pairs (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), the answer is 0 as no road needed to travel.\nFor pair (0,1), there is a directed road with minimum possible cost -5.\nFor pair (0,2), although there is a directed road with cost 2, but path (0 -> 1 -> 2) gives minimum, i.e., -5+4 = -1.\nFor pair (0,3), the minimum cost path is (0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3) with cost -5+4+1 = 0.\nFor pair (1,2), there is a direct road with minimum possible cost 4.\nFor pair (1,3), the minimum cost path is (1 -> 2 -> 3) with cost 4+1 = 5.\nFor pair (2,3), there is a direct road with minimum possible cost 1.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2:\n```\n2\n4 4\n1 2 3\n2 3 3\n3 1 3\n3 2 -3\n3 4\n1 2 -1\n2 3 -2\n2 1 -1\n3 1 5\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2:\n```\n0 -1 -1 -1\n-1 0 3 6\n-1 6 0 3\n-1 3 -3 0\n-1 -1 -1\n-1 -1 -1\n-1 -1 -1\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nvector<vector<int>> eachPath(int N, int M, vector<vector<int>>& roads)\n{\n// Write your code here.\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

While practicing the questions of Linked List, he found a very interesting question in which a sorted doubly linked list is given,, and the task is to construct a balanced Binary search tree having the same elements as of the given Linked List. Can you help Ninja to solve this problem?\nA balanced BST is defined as a binary search tree that follows a special property that the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.\n**For Example:** ```\nIf the given linked list is [1,4,5,8,9], then the balanced BST will :\n\n```\n\n![Example](https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/asset_0000000000000522_1635450074_tree1.png)\n**Note :** ```\nWe will be using a single structure, ‘NODE’, to define both the List Node and Tree Node.\nIt will have the following members:\n   1. 'VAL' to store the integer data value.\n   2. 'PREV' pointer to store the address of the previous node and also used to store the address of the left child.\n  3.

The amusement park has only one entrance that is root.\nEach ride has a fun number assigned to it and ninja wants to maximize this fun but there is a rule in the park that no one is allowed to ride two directly connected rides.\nAs the ninja is smart and good in programming because he did a course from coding ninja, he found immediately that park rides are connected like binary tree where the root is the root of the binary tree. Help the ninja to get the maximum fun this time.\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \nInput Format:\n```\nThe first line of input contains an integer 'T' representing the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains a fun number assigned to each ride in the level order form. The line consists of values of nodes separated by a single space. In case a node is null, we take -1 in its place.\nFor example, the input for the tree depicted in the below image would be :\n\n```\n\n![](https://files.codingninjas.in/screenshot-from-2021-03-25-09-02-21-8525.png)\n```\n4\n2 6\n1 3 5 7\n-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n\n```\n\nExplanation:\n```\nLevel 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 4\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 4 = 2\nRight child of 4 = 6\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 1\nRight child of 2 = 3\nLeft child of 6 = 5\nRight child of 6 = 7\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 1 = null (-1)\nRight child of 1 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 3 = null (-1)\nRight child of 3 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\nThe first not-null node(of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level. The second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null(-1).\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nThe above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space.

Initially, every cell is locked, and ‘GRID[i][j]’ represents the time at which the cell at ‘(i, j)’ will unlock. You can move from one cell to another 4-dimensionally adjacent cell if and only if both cells are unlocked. You can move through infinite cells in zero time. Also, you cannot leave the boundaries of the grid.\nIf you start at the cell ‘(0, 0)’, what is the least time required to reach the last cell ‘(N - 1, N - 1)’.\n**Example:** ```\n‘GRID’ =\n\n```\n\n![example](https://files.codingninjas.in/example-8821.png)\n```\nWe cannot reach the cell ‘(2, 2)’ until the time is ‘5’. When the time is ‘5’, we move along the path: \n0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5\nThe cell with value ‘1’ will be unlocked when the time is ‘1’.\nAt time = 1: 0 -> 1\nSimilarly, the cell with value ‘4’ is unlocked when the time is ‘4’. At that time the cell with value ‘3’ will also be unlocked, as it unlocks at time ‘3’.  \nAt time = 4: 0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3\nThe cell with value ‘5’ will be unlocked when the time is ‘5’.\nAt time = 5: 0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5\nSo, the least time to reach cell ‘(2, 2)’ is ‘5’.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\n1. All elements in the ‘GRID’ are unique.\n2. ‘GRID[i][j]’ is a permutation of [0, 1, … , (N ^ 2) - 1].\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input format:** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer ‘T’ which denotes the number of test cases. Then, the ‘T’ test cases follow.\nEach test case’s first line contains an integer ‘N’ denoting the number of rows and columns in ‘GRID’. Then, ‘N’ lines follow.\nEach line contains ‘N’ space-separated integers denoting the row values of ‘GRID’.\n\n```\n**Output format:** ```\nFor every test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting the least time required to reach the cell ‘(N - 1, N - 1)’.\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n\n```\n\nNote:\n```\nYou do not need to input or print anything, as it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:** ```\n1 <= T <= 10\n2 <= N <= 50\n0 <= Value in each element of ‘GRID’ <= (N ^ 2) - 1\nWhere ‘T’ is the number of test cases, and ‘N’ is the number of rows and columns in ‘GRID’.\nTime limit: 1 second\n\n```\n\n#### Sample input 1:\n```\n2\n4\n3 4 15 14 \n12 0 10 9 \n11 8 7 6 \n13 5 2 1 \n2\n0 1 \n2 3 \n\n```\n\n#### Sample output 1:\n```\n8\n3\n\n```\n\n#### Explanation of sample input 1:\n```\nTest Case 1:\n‘grid’ = \n\n```\n\n![sample1](https://files.codingninjas.in/sample1-8822.png)\n```\nWe cannot reach the cell ‘(3, 3)’ until the time is ‘8’. When the time is ‘8’, we move along the path:\n3 -> 4 -> 0 -> 8 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1\nSo, the least time to reach ‘(3, 3)’ is ‘8’.\nTest Case 2:\n‘grid’ = \n\n```\n\n![sample2](https://files.codingninjas.in/sample2-8823.png)\n```\nWe cannot reach the cell ‘(1, 1)’ until the time is ‘3’.

You are supposed to find the left view of the binary tree. The left view of a binary tree is the set of all nodes that are visible when the binary tree is viewed from the left side.\n**Example:**\n![example](https://files.codingninjas.in/leftview_0-6345.png)\n```\nThe left view of the above binary tree is {5, 7, 14, 25}.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line contains an integer 'T' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.\nThe only line of each test case contains elements in the level order form. The line consists of values of nodes separated by a single space. In case a node is null, we take -1 in its place. So -1 would not be a part of the tree nodes.\nFor example, the input for the tree depicted in the below image will be:\n\n```\n\n![alt text](https://files.codingninjas.in/0000000000004189.png)\n```\n1\n2 3\n4 -1 5 6\n-1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1\n-1 -1\n\n```\n\nExplanation :\n```\nLevel 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 1\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 1 = 2\nRight child of 1 = 3\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 4\nRight child of 2 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 3 = 5\nRight child of 3 = 6\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 4 = null (-1)\nRight child of 4 = 7\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 6 = null (-1)\nRight child of 6 = null (-1)\nLevel 5 :\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\nThe first not-null node(of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level. The second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null(-1).\n\n```\n**Note :** ```\nThe above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space.

Bob is a good husband, so he goes out with his wife every Friday to ‘Arcade’ mall.\n‘Arcade’ is a very famous mall in Berland. It has a very unique transportation method between shops. Since the shops in the mall are laying in a straight line, you can jump on a very advanced trampoline from the shop i, and land in any shop between (i) to (i + Arr[i]), where Arr[i] is a constant given for each shop.\nThere are N shops in the mall, numbered from 0 to N-1. Bob's wife starts her shopping journey from shop 0 and ends it in shop N-1. As the mall is very crowded on Fridays, unfortunately, Bob gets lost from his wife. So he wants to know, what is the minimum number of trampoline jumps from shop 0 he has to make in order to reach shop N-1 and see his wife again. If it is impossible to reach the last shop, return -1.\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input format :** ```\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T, representing the number of test cases or queries to be run. \nThen the T test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains a positive integer N, which represents the number of shops.\nThe next line contains 'N' single space-separated positive integers representing a constant given for each shop.\n\n```\n**Output Format :** ```\nFor each test case, print the minimum number of jumps or -1, if it is impossible to reach the last shop.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.

Your task is to find the sum of all the left leaf nodes.\nProperties of leaf:-\nIn a binary tree, a leaf is a node such that it does not have any children. Node ‘1’ is always the root of the binary tree. Left leaves are those nodes that are the left child of their parent and a leaf node.\n**Example:** ```\nLet’s say you have a binary tree as follows:-\n\n```\n\n![subsequence](https://files.codingninjas.in/tree-8583.png)\nNode 4 and Node 5 are leaf nodes and left child of their parent.

Just implement the function.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer ‘t’ denoting the number of test cases.\nThe next ‘t’ lines represent the ‘t’ test cases.\nThe first line of input contains the elements of the tree in the level order form separated by a single space.\nIf any node does not have a left or right child, take -1 in its place. Refer to the example below.\nExample:\nElements are in the level order form. The input consists of values of nodes separated by a single space in a single line.

You have to invert this binary tree. Inversion must be done by following all the below guidelines:\n```\n• The given leaf node becomes the root after the inversion.\n• For a node (say, ‘x’) \n  ○ If there exists the left child that is not yet taken then this child must become the right child of ‘x’.\n  ○ If the left child is already taken then the right child is still on the right side of ‘x’.\n• The parent of ‘x’ must be the left child of ‘x’.\n\n```\n\nFor Example:\n![Example-img01](https://files.codingninjas.in/invert-a-binary-tree-01-8578.png) ![Example-img02](https://files.codingninjas.in/invert-a-binary-tree-02-8579.png)\n```\nConsider the above binary tree (image- before inversion), if the given leaf node is ‘1’ then the binary tree after inversion becomes exactly the same as given in the image representing after inversion.\n\n```\n\nNote:\n```\nThe given binary tree will only have distinct values of nodes.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line contains a single integer ‘T’ representing the number of test cases. \nThe first line of each test case will contain a single TreeNode “leaf” which denotes one of the leaf nodes of the given binary tree.\nThe second line of each test case contains elements of the tree in the level order form. The line consists of values of nodes separated by a single space. In case a node is null, we take -1 in its place.\nFor example, the input for the tree depicted in the below image would be :\n\n```\n\n![Example](https://files.codingninjas.in/btree-5038.png)\n```\n1\n2 3\n4 -1 5 6\n-1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1\n-1 -1\n\n```\n\nExplanation :\n```\nLevel 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 1\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 1 = 2\nRight child of 1 = 3\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 4\nRight child of 2 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 3 = 5\nRight child of 3 = 6\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 4 = null (-1)\nRight child of 4 = 7\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 6 = null (-1)\nRight child of 6 = null (-1)\nLevel 5 :\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\nThe first not-null node(of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level. The second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null(-1).\n\n```\n**Note :** ```\nThe above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space. Hence, for the above-depicted tree, the input will be given as:\n1 2 3 4 -1 5 6 -1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, return the whole binary tree (according to the format as it has been given in the input) after considering the given leaf node as the new root node.\nOutput for every test case will be printed in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou don’t need to print anything; It has already been taken care of.

Each of the balls has a colour that can be represented by a number between 1 and 10^9.\nFor each 'i' = 0, 1, 2.. 'N-1', the colour of the 'i-th' ball from the left is Colour 'Ai'.\nNinja can choose 'K' consecutive balls from this row. That is, he can choose an integer 'i' such that 0 <= i <= 'N - K' and get the balls 'i', 'i+1', 'i+2' … '(i+k-1)' from the left. Additionally, he can choose at most one of those 'K' balls and repaint it to a colour of his choice.\nNinja wants to get the maximum variety in colours in the selected 'K' consecutive balls, and for this, he will choose some optimal 'i'. Return the maximum possible number of distinct colours in balls he can get.\n**Example :** ```\n‘N’ = '6'\n'K' = '3'\nThe next line contains 'Ai', the colour of the 'ith' ball from the left,\n1 2 1 3 2 3\nAssuming 0-based indexing, If Ninja gets the balls from index 2 to 4, i.e., the contiguous set {1,3,2} he will have 3 different coloured balls, which is the maximum possible answer.\nHe can also get the balls from index 1 to 3, i.e., the set {2,1,3}.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format :** ```\nThe first line contains an integer 'T', which denotes the number of test cases to be run.

The sweetness of each chunk is given in an array ‘ARR’. Ninja has ‘K’ friends, and he wishes to divide the chocolate into 'K' + 1 cut with some consecutive chunks. He wants to divide the chocolate into chunks under the condition that he will take the piece that has the minimum total sweetness.\nHe is very busy doing other stuff. Can you help him to maximize the total sweetness of the part that you will get under the given condition?\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer ‘T’, denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, ‘N’ and ‘K’, denoting the size of array ‘ARR’ and the number of friends Ninja has.\nThe second line of each test case contains ‘N’ space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array ‘ARR’.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, print the maximum sweetness that Ninja can get under the given condition.\nPrint the output of each test case in a new line.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou are not required to print the expected output, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:** ```\n1<= T <= 10\n1 <= N <= 50000\n0 <= K < N\n1 <= ARR[i] <= 10000\nWhere 'ARR[i]' is the sweetness of the ‘i_th' chunk.\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1:\n```\n2\n9 3\n5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13\n3 2\n2 2 2\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1:\n```\n17\n2\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation for Sample Input 1:\n```\nIn the first test case, the sweetness of the chunks are [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] and Ninja has 3 friends. So, it is to be divided among 4 people including Ninja himself. In order to maximize the total sweetness of Ninja, one possible division is [5, 6, 7], [8, 9], [10, 11], [12, 13]. The minimum sweetness of one part is 17. So, the answer is 17.\nIn the second test case, the sweetness of the chunks are [2, 2, 2] and Ninja has 2 friends. So, it is to be divided among 3 people, and there are only 3 chunks. So, all three friends will be getting one chunk each. So, the total sweetness that Ninja will get is 2. So, the answer is 2.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2:\n```\n2\n3 2\n5 6 7\n10 4\n2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2:\n```\n5\n5\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nint getMaximumSweetness(vector<int> &arr, int k)\n{\n// Write your code here.\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

Since Stark Tower has limited rooms available for the meeting, Tony decided to allot a room to each meeting so that all the meetings are organized in the least possible conference rooms, and a the moment, only one meeting will happen in one room. So, he asked JARVIS to allot each meeting a room and tell the minimum number of conference rooms to be reserved. But, since JARVIS was busy rendering another Iron Man suit model, he asked you to help.\nYou are given an array of integers ARR of size N x 2, representing the start and end time for N meetings. Your task is to find the minimum number of rooms required to organize all the meetings.\nNote:\n```\n1. You can assume that all the meetings will happen on the same day.\n2. Also, as soon as a meeting gets over if some other meeting is scheduled to start at that moment, they can then be allocated that room.\n\n```\n\nNote:\n```\nTry to solve the problem in linear time complexity.\n\n```\n\nFor Example:\n```\nConsider there are three meetings scheduled with timings:\n1pm - 4pm\n3pm - 5pm\n4pm - 6pm\nAt the start of time, meeting 1 will be allotted room 1, which will be occupied till 4 pm hence for meeting 2 we’ll have to provide another room. At 4 pm, meeting 3 can be organized in room 1 because by that time, meeting 1 would have ended. Hence we’ll require two rooms for holding all three meetings.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input format** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer 'T' representing the number of the test cases. Then the test case follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer ‘N’ representing the number of meetings scheduled.\nThe second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers representing the start time for each meeting.\nThe third line of each test case contains N space-separated integers representing the end time for each meeting.\n\n```\n**Output Format** ```\nFor each test case, print the minimum number of conference rooms required.\nThe output of each test case should be printed in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:** ```\n1 <= T <= 100\n1 <= N <= 1000\n0000 <= INTERVAL[start][end] <= 2359\nwhere 'T' is the number of test cases, 'N' is the number of meetings, and 'INTERVAL[start][end]' represents the starting time and ending time of a meeting.\nTime limit: 1 second\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1:\n```\n3\n2\n0100 0500\n0300 0600\n3\n0100 0300 0400\n0400 0500 0600\n3\n0100 0300 0200\n0700 0500 0300\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1:\n```\n1\n2\n2\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation of Input 1:\n```\n(i) Occupancy of rooms - Room 1: (1-3) (5-6)\n(ii) Occupancy of rooms - Room 1: (1-4) (4-6) Room 2: (3-5) \n(iii) Occupancy of rooms - Room 1: (2-3) (3-5) Room 2: (1-7) \n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2:\n```\n3\n1\n0100\n1000\n5\n0100 0500 0300 0400 0600\n0300 0800 0500 0800 0950\n6\n0100 0900 0100 0300 0200 0400\n0200 1200 0200 0400 0600 0700\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2:\n```\n1\n3\n2\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation of Input 2:\n```\n(i) Occupancy of rooms - Room 1: (1-10)\n(ii) Occupancy of rooms - Room 1: (1-3) (3-5) (5-8) Room 2: (4-8) Room 3: (6-9:50) \n(iii) Occupancy of rooms - Room 1: (1-2) (3-4) (4-7) Room 2: (1-2) (2-6) (9-12) \n\n```\n\nJavascript (node v10.20.0) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n/* Declare and implement your function here \neg: function example(parameter_name1,parameter_name2....){}\nHandle the input/output from main()\n*/\nprocess.stdin.resume();\nprocess.stdin.setEncoding('ascii');\nvar input_stdin = \"\";\nvar input_stdin_array = \"\";\nvar input_currentline = 0;\nprocess.stdin.on('data', function (data) {\ninput_stdin += data;\n});\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

Now, the instructor will input a test sentence(at least one word and end with ‘#’). As Ninja’s best friend, can you help him with the assignment?\nYour task is to implement the AutocompleteSystemclass:\n  * AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times)Initializes the object with the sentences and times arrays.\n  * List input(char c)This indicates that the user typed the character c. \n    * Returns an empty array [], if c == '#' and stores the inputted sentence in the system.\n    * Returns the top 3 historical hot sentences with the same prefix as the sentence already typed. If there are fewer than 3matches, return them all.\n\n\nHere are the specific rules:\n  * A sentence’s hot degree is defined as the number of times a user typed the same sentence before.\n  * The returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first is the hottest one). If several sentences have the same hot degree, use ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).\n  * If less than three hot sentences exist, return as many as possible.\n  * When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, you need to return an empty list.\n\n\nFor Example:\n```\nInput:\n[\"AutocompleteSystem\",\"input\",\"input\",\"input\"]\n[[[\"i want to join faang\",\"icecream\",\"i love coding ninjas\"],[4,3,1],[\"i\"],[\"s\"],[\"#\"]]\nOutput:\n[null,[\"i want to join faang\",\"icecream\",\"i love coding ninjas\"],[],[]]\nExplanation:\n* AutocompleteSystem obj = new AutocompleteSystem([\"i want to join faang\",\"icecream\",\"i love coding ninjas\"],[4,3,1]); \n* obj.input(“i”); // return [\"i want to join faang\",\"icecream\",\"i love coding ninjas\"].

So his parents on his birthday gave him a task on strings as a present. The task is as follows:\nThere is the main string ‘STR’ of length ‘N’ consisting of only lowercase English letters, and there is an array of strings ‘ARR’ of length ‘M’, where each string consists of only lowercase English letters. Now Shail has to find the count of such strings in the array ‘ARR’ which occurs as a subsequence in the string ‘STR’ and tell it to their parents.\nBut Shail is busy with his birthday celebration and cannot solve the task, but want to make his parents happy by giving them the answer to the task, So being his friend he asked you to solve this problem, Can you help him?.\nNOTE: A subsequence of a given sequence, is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. [For more details please visit this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence).\n**EXAMPLE :** ```\nInput: ‘N’ = 5, ‘M' = 2, ‘STR’ = “abcde” , ‘ARR’ = [“ad”, “cb”]\nOutput: 1\nIn this case, string “ad” occurs as a subsequence in the string ‘STR’ and the index of the match is ‘0’ and ‘3’ respectively. Also, string “cb” isn’t a subsequence because there is no occurrence of ‘b’ after the first ‘c’ at index ‘2’. Hence the output will be ‘1’.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format :** ```\nThe first line will contain the integer ‘T’, the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers, ‘N’ and ‘M’ , denoting the length of string and array respectively.\nFollowed by a line containing the string ‘STR’ of length.\nFollowed by ‘M’ lines, each containing the string of the array ‘ARR’. \n\n```\n**Output format :** ```\nFor each test case, print the count of strings in the array ‘ARR’ that occurs as a subsequence in the string ‘STR’.\n\n```\n**Note :** ```\nYou don't need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints :** ```\n1 <= ‘T’ <= 10\n1 <= ‘N’ <= 10^4\nSTR.length = N\n1 <= ‘M’ <= 10^4\n‘STR’ only consists of lowercase English letters.\nIt is guaranteed that sum of ‘N’ over all test cases is <= 10^5\nIt is guaranteed that sum of lengths of strings in array ‘ARR’ over all test cases is <= 10^5\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1 :\n```\n2\n5 1\nvirat\nvat\n10 3\nhelloworld\noo\nabcdefghijk\nhewd\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1 :\n```\n1\n2\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :\n```\nFor the first test case,\nThe matching sequence index for string “vat” is = [‘0’, ‘3’, ‘4’].\nHence, the output will be: 1\nFor the second test case,\nThe matching sequence index for string “oo” is = [‘4’, ‘6’].\nThere is no matching sequence index for string “abcdefghijk”.\nThe matching sequence index for string “hewd” is = [‘0’, ‘1’, ‘5’, ‘9’].\nHence, the output will be: 2\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2 :\n```\n2\n10 4\nbtovxbkumc\nbtovxbku\nto\nzueoxxxjme\nyjkclbkbtl\n26 2\nbcdaefhgikjlmonprqstuvxwzy\nempty\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2 :\n```\n2\n1\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nint subsequenceGame(int n, int m, string str, vector<string> &arr) {\n// Write your code here.\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

You are also given an integer ‘K’.\nNinja thinks that a number is stable if the following condition is satisfied:\nFor every ‘ith’ digit where (0 <= ‘i’ <= ‘B-1’) ‘S[i] = S[i%K]’. Here, ‘X%Y’ represents the modulo operations. The remainder when ‘X’ is divided by ‘Y’.\nYour task is to find the smallest number which is stable and whose value is greater than or equal to ‘A’. Zero-based indexing is used everywhere.\n**Example :** ```\n‘B’ = 4, ‘S’ = “4321”, ‘K’ = 3.\nThe given number is not stable as ‘S[3]’ is not the same as ‘S[0]’ but 3%3 = 0 same as 0%3. ‘S[3] = 1’ and ‘S[0] = 4’. But the number “4324” is stable. As, for all ‘i’, ‘S[i]’ = ‘S[i%K]’ and “4324” is also greater than the given number. It can be proved that this is the best possible answer.\nHence, the answer is “4324”.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format :** ```\nThe first line contains a single integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases, then the test case follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two single space-separated integers, ‘B’ and ‘K'.\nThe second line contains a string with ‘B’ characters representing the string ‘S’.\n\n```\n**Output Format :** ```\nFor each test case, return the minimum stable number whose value is the same or exceeds the value of ‘A’.\nOutput for each test case will be printed on a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note :** ```\nYou are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints :** ```\n1 ≤ T ≤ 10\n1 ≤ B ≤ 10^5\n1 ≤ K ≤ 10^9\nIt’s guaranteed that sum of ‘B’ over all cases does not exceed 10^5. \nThe given number will not contain leading zeros.\nTime limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1 :\n```\n2\n4 2\n6825\n3 3\n420\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1 :\n```\n6868\n420\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation For Sample Input 1 :\n```\nFor test case 1: \n6868 is the minimum possible, stable number. We can see that it is stable because ‘S[0] = S[2]’ because 0%2 = 2%2, and ‘S[1] = S[3]’ because 1%2 = 3%2. All the conditions are satisfied.\nHence, 6868 is the answer.\nFor test case 2:\nThe given number itself is stable, and hence it is the best possible answer.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2 :\n```\n2\n5 1\n40369\n4 2\n8516\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2 :\n```\n44444\n8585\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\nstring findStableNumber(int k, string &s) {\n// Write your code here.\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

The Government is trying to increase its vaccination drives. Ninja wants to help the Government to plan an effective method to help increase vaccination following safety measures. Time is running out. Can you help the nation?\nYou are given two positive integers: ‘n,’ ‘maxVaccines’ denoting the number of days for which this vaccination drive will go on and the total number of vaccines available for the drive, respectively. You have to find the number of vaccines administered each day. You are also given a number ‘dayNumber,’ and we are interested to know the maximum number of vaccines that can be administered on ‘dayNumber’ th day.\nThe rules of the vaccination drive :\n1. There should be a positive number of vaccines administered each day during the vaccination drive.\n2. The absolute difference between the number of vaccines in two consecutive days should not exceed 1.\n3. The sum of all the elements of the vaccines array does not exceed maxVaccines, that is, you cannot administer more vaccines than what is provided to you.\n4. Vaccines administered on ‘dayNumber’ th day should be maximized.\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer ‘T,’ denoting the number of test cases. The test cases follow.\nThe first line contains three space-separated integers ‘n’, ‘dayNumber,’ and ‘maxVaccines,’ denoting the number of days for which this vaccination drive will go on, the total number of vaccines available for the campaign, and the day for which the number of vaccines administered needs to be maximized respectively.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, print an integer denoting the maximum number of vaccines administered on the day ‘dayNumber’.\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou are not required to print the expected output; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:** ```\n1<= T <= 50\n1 <= n <= maxVaccines <= 10^9\n0 <= dayNumber < n\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1:\n```\n2\n4 3 9\n4 2 6\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1:\n```\n3\n2\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation for Sample Input 1:\n```\nIn the first test case, the number of days for which vaccination drive will go on is 4, and we are required to find the maximum number of vaccines on day 3 under the condition that the total number of vaccines doesn’t exceed 9 during the vaccination drive.\nNinja can have 1 vaccine on day 1, 2 vaccines on day 2, 3 vaccines on day 3, and 3 vaccines on day 4. This satisfies all the conditions.\nSo we can have a maximum of 3 vaccines on day 3.\nIn the second test case, the number of days for which vaccination drive will go on is,4 and we are required to find the maximum number of vaccines on day 2 under the condition that the total number of vaccines doesn’t exceed 6 during the vaccination drive. \nNinja can have 1 vaccine on day 1, 2 vaccines on day 2, 2 vaccines on day 3, and 1 vaccine on day 4. This satisfies all the conditions.\nSo we can have a maximum of 2 vaccines on day 2.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2:\n```\n2\n10 8 70\n20 12 35\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2:\n```\n10\n4\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nint maxVaccinesAdministered(int n, int dayNumber, int maxVaccines)\n{\n// Write your code here\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

The houses are either painted red or blue. The house colours are given in an integer array ‘color’, where 0 denotes the ith house is painted red, and 1 denotes the ith house is painted blue. The residents of a house will be happy if their house colour is different from both its neighbours if they exist. Hence, the Mayor decided to repaint some of the houses. But due to financial reasons, he wants to paint a minimum number of houses. Can you calculate the minimum number of houses that he needs to repaint?\nExample: Suppose there are 3 houses and the colours [1, 1, 1], which means all the houses are coloured blue. If the Mayor repaints the second house to red, we will have the colours as [1, 0, 1]. We can see that all the neighbours will be happy. Hence, the minimum number of houses to be repainted is 1.\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line contains ‘T’, denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers, ‘N’ denoting the number of houses.\nThe second line of each test case contains an array ‘color’ containing ‘N’ space-separated integers.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, print a single integer, denoting the minimum number of houses that need to be repainted.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou are not required to print the expected output.

Alex has ‘N’ photos, whose resolution is given in an integer array ‘photos’. The machine has some downsides as well. The error in photocopying a batch is the absolute difference between the highest resolution photo and the lowest resolution photo in the batch.\nNow Alex will divide the photos into some groups of size at least ‘K’ and feed it to the machine. The maximum error is the maximum of the errors from each batch. He wants to minimize the maximum error. Can you help him divide the photos into batches efficiently and tell him the minimum maximum error he can achieve?\nExample: Let the resolutions be [1, 5, 2] and K = 2. So there is only one way of dividing the array, which is a single group of all three elements. The error is therefore 5 - 1 = 4.\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line contains ‘T’, denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, ‘N’ and ‘K’, denoting the number of photos and the minimum size of each batch.\nThe second line of each test case contains an array ‘photos’ of ‘N’ space-separated integers, denoting the resolution of the ith photo.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, print an integer denoting the minimum ‘maximum error’.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou are not required to print the expected output. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:** ```\n1 <= T <= 10\n1 <= K <= N <= 10^4\n1 <= photos[i] <= 10^9\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1:\n```\n2\n5 2\n50 110 130 40 120\n4 1\n2 3 4 1\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1:\n```\n20\n0\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation for Sample Input 1:\n```\nIn the first test case, the photos should be split into 2 groups: [40, 50] and [110, 120, 130]. The processing time of the first group is 10, and the processing time of the second group is 20. The maximum between 10 and 20 is 20. It is impossible to split the photos into groups in such a way that the processing time of division is less than 20.\nIn the second test case, the photos should be split into four groups, each containing one photo. So the minimal possible processing time of a division is 0.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2:\n```\n2\n5 2\n5 7 3 3 5\n3 2\n1 2 3\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2:\n```\n2\n2\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\nint photography(int n, int k, vector<int> &photos) {\n// Write your code here.\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

During summers, he got a total of ‘X’ clients for a trip to a nearby waterpark. Ninja has a total of ‘N’ taxis where each taxi takes different routes to reach the destination.\nNinja has an array ‘taxiTravelTime’ representing how long it takes for each taxi (at that index of the array) to make a trip. Ninja wants to know the minimum time required to make ‘X’ trips.\nNinja wants to schedule a certain number of trips with a collection of several taxis.\nYou have to return the minimum time required to make ‘X’ trips.\nNote :\n```\nAssume that taxis can run simultaneously and there is no waiting period between trips. There may be multiple taxis with the same time cost.\n\n```\n\nExample:\n```\nIf ‘X=3’, ‘N=2’ and ‘taxiTravelTime=[1,2]’, \nThen the answer is 2.

Each element of this array is a string. The teacher taught Ninja about prefixes in the past, so he wants to test his knowledge.\nA string is called a complete string if every prefix of this string is also present in the array ‘A’. Ninja is challenged to find the longest complete string in the array ‘A’.If there are multiple strings with the same length, return the lexicographically smallest one and if no string exists, return \"None\".\n**Note :** ```\nString ‘P’ is lexicographically smaller than string ‘Q’, if : \n1. There exists some index ‘i’ such that for all ‘j’ < ‘i’ , ‘P[j] = Q[j]’ and ‘P[i] < Q[i]’. E.g. “ninja” < “noder”.\n2. If ‘P’ is a prefix of string ‘Q’, e.g. “code” < “coder”.\n\n```\n**Example :** ```\nN = 4\nA = [ “ab” , “abc” , “a” , “bp” ] \nExplanation : \nOnly prefix of the string “a” is “a” which is present in array ‘A’. So, it is one of the possible strings.\nPrefixes of the string “ab” are “a” and “ab” both of which are present in array ‘A’. So, it is one of the possible strings.\nPrefixes of the string “bp” are “b” and “bp”. “b” is not present in array ‘A’. So, it cannot be a valid string.\nPrefixes of the string “abc” are “a”,“ab” and “abc” all of which are present in array ‘A’. So, it is one of the possible strings.\nWe need to find the maximum length string, so “abc” is the required string.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format :** ```\nThe first line contains an integer 'T' which denotes the number of test cases to be run. Then the test cases follow.\nThe second line of each test case contains an integer ‘N’ denoting the size of array ‘A’.\nThe third line of each test case contains ‘N’ space-separated strings denoting the elements of array ‘A’.\n\n```\n**Output format :** ```\nFor each test case, print the longest string in ‘A’, such that every prefix of this string is also present in the array ‘A’. If there are multiple strings with the same length, return the lexicographically smallest one and if no string exists, return \"None\" as answer.\nPrint the output of each test case in a new line.\n\n```\n**Note :** ```\nYou don’t need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints :** ```\n1 <= T <= 10\n1 <= N <= 10^5\n1 <= A[i].length <= 10^5\nA[i] only consists of lowercase english letters.\nSum of A[i].length <= 10^5 over all test cases\nTime Limit : 1 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1 :\n```\n2\n6\nn ni nin ninj ninja ninga\n2\nab bc\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1 :\n```\nninja\nNone\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :\n```\nFor test case 1 we have, \nAll the prefixes of “ninja” -> “n”, “ni”, “nin”, “ninj” and “ninja” are present in array ‘A’.

Therefore the total changes for this path is 0.\nAs we can see the minimum changes required to reach the bottom-right cell is Zero therefore the answer is 0 in this case.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input format** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases.\nThen the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains space-separated two numbers 'N' and 'M' denoting the number of rows and the number of columns in the grid respectively.\nThe next 'N' lines of each test case contain 'M' characters denoting the directions.\n\n```\n**Output format:** ```\nFor each test case, print the minimum number of cells whose direction value is required to be changed so that there exists a path from Top-Left to the Bottom-Right cell.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:** ```\n1 <= T <= 10\n1 <= N, M <= 100\nEach cell of the grid will only have one of ['U', 'L', 'D', 'R'] character.\nTime Limit: 1sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1:\n```\n2\n2 3\nDRD\nDRL\n1 4\nRRRR\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1:\n```\n1\n0\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation For Sample Input 1:\n```\nFor the first test case:\n\n```\n\n![sample inp](https://files.codingninjas.in/screenshot-2021-01-06-104711-6945.png)\n```\nWe can change the value of the leftmost cell of the bottom row from 'D' to 'R' or we can change the value of the starting cell from 'D' to 'R' to get a path from the Top-Left to \nBottom-Right cell. Therefore, the minimum direction change required in this case is 1.\nFor the second test case:\nAll the cells only allow moving to the right direction. So a path from leftmost to the rightmost cell already exists in this case. Therefore, the answer is 0 in this case.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2:\n```\n2 \n3 3\nDRR\nDRR\nDRR\n1 1\nL\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2:\n```\n1\n0\n\n```\n\nJavascript (node v10.20.0) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n/* Declare and implement your function here \neg: function example(parameter_name1,parameter_name2....){}\nHandle the input/output from main()\n*/\nprocess.stdin.resume();\nprocess.stdin.setEncoding('ascii');\nvar input_stdin = \"\";\nvar input_stdin_array = \"\";\nvar input_currentline = 0;\nprocess.stdin.on('data', function (data) {\ninput_stdin += data;\n});\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

You have also given a list of banned words. Now your task is to find the most frequent word which is not in the list of banned words. There will always be a solution, and the solution will be unique.\nWhile comparing words, you can ignore whether the letter is lowercase or uppercase. For example, ‘AsK’ and ‘aSK’ are the same. The words will always contain only alphabets or we can say words will be separated by spaces or punctuation. The answer will be in uppercase letters.\nThe words in the banned list will always be in upper letters and free from punctuation and spaces.\nFor example :\n```\nParagraph = ‘It's a square SqUare. It's a FLAT flat.’ \nBanned =[FLAT, IT, S]. \nSo we can see these words [IT, S, SQUARE, FLAT ] are most frequent.\nNow we will look at to banned list and we can see 3 of the words are banned.\nSo we have a unique answer SQUARE which has a frequency of 2 and not on the banned list.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \nInput Format:\n```\nThe first line of input contains a string PARAGRAPH.\nThe second line of input contains an integer 'N' representing the size of the banned words list.\nThe third line of input contains 'N' space-separated words BANNEDWORDS.\n\n```\n\nOutput format:\n```\nPrint the word (in UPPERCASE) which is most frequent and is not present in the list of banned words.\n\n```\n\nNote :\n```\nYou don’t have to print anything.

You are given an array ‘CHOCOLATES’, representing the number of chocolates ‘ith’ child wants but the shop only has ‘C’ chocolates. Children can only take chocolate from that shop if the following two conditions are satisfied:\n```\n1. The student must be able to take all the chocolates that they want to take.\n2. All their friends must be able to take all the chocolates they want to take.\n\n```\n\nThere are ‘M’ pairs of friends among the children.

Each cell of the matrix has some gold coins. Initially, Ninja will start from the cell (1,1) and will move to cell (2, N) which the following moves:\n```\n1. Move Right - From cell (i,j) to cell (i,j+1).\n2. Move Down - From cell (i,j) to cell (i+1,j).\n\n```\n\nNinja will pick the coins from each cell he visits. Now, it’s his friend’s turn. He also performs the moves to reach (2, N) from (1,1). But he can collect only the coins that Ninja hasn’t picked.\nThe score of the game is the total coins picked by Ninja’s Friend. Ninja will try to minimize the score while his friend will try to maximize the score. Find the score of the game if both the players play optimally.\nYou are given a matrix ‘M’ of size 2*N. Your task is to find the score of the game if both players play optimally.\n**For Example** ```\nIf the given matrix is ‘M’ = [ [1,3, 9] , [3,5,1 ].The path taken by \nNinja is 1,3,9,1 and the path taken by his friend is 1,3,5,1. So the total coins picked by his friend is 3+5 =8.\nSo, the score is 8.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of the input contains an integer, 'T,’ denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer, 'N’ denoting the number of columns in the matrix.\nThe next two lines contain N elements representing row 1 and row 2 of the matrix.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, print an integer corresponding to the score of the game if both players play optimally. \nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou do not need to print anything.

His friend will follow the path 1,3,5,1 .So the total coins collected by his friend is 3+5 as all other are already collected by Ninja.So the score is 8.Hence,the answer is 8. \nFor the second test case:\nOne of the optimal path for Ninja is 1,3,5,1.His friend will follow the path 1,3,7,1 .So the total coins collected by his friend is 7. So the score is 7. Hence, the answer is 7.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2:\n```\n2\n4\n6 4 6 1 \n5 7 8 7 \n4\n7 7 10 5 \n2 7 10 5\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2:\n```\n7\n9\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\nint coinsAndRows(int n, vector<vector<int>> &m)\n{\n// Write your code here.\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

Now, the ninja wants to show this plane to his best friend, whose house lies at point (X, 0) on the x-axis. There are multiple airports on the x-axis marked by 1. If there is no airport at any point, then it is marked as 0.\nGiven an integer array ‘AIRPORTS’ of size ‘N’ containing the information about airports on the x-axis, can you find the minimum number of stops that must be taken by the plane to reach the destination (X,0) on the x-axis. If the destination is unreachable, return -1. The plane starts from the origin (0, 0).\n**For example:** ```\nYou are given AIRPORTS = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0], ‘K’ = 2 and ‘X’ = 4.\nThe answer will be 1. The plane makes its first stop at (2, 0) and then reaches the destination (4, 0) in the next fight. Hence the total number of stops is 1.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line contains an integer 'T' which denotes the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers, ‘N’, ‘K’, ’X’, representing the length of the ‘AIRPORTS’ array, maximum distance covered by plane in one flight, and destination on the x-axis, respectively.\nThe second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers, representing the information about the airports on the x-axis.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, print a single integer, denoting the minimum number of stops that must be taken by the plane to reach the destination (X,0) on the x-axis.\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:** ```\n1 <= T <= 10 \n1 <= N <= 5000\n1 <= K < N \n1 <= X < N\n0 <= AIRPORTS[i] <= 1\nTime limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou do not need to input or print anything, as it has already been taken care of.

The nodes are numbered from 1 to ‘N’. Initially, Ninja is present on the 1st node. Each node has a weight associated with it given in array ‘WEIGHT’. Ninja needs to travel all the nodes on the following conditions:\n```\n1. Start from node 1 and move to the next unvisited node having the highest weight.\n2. If two or more nodes have the same weight, move to the node, which takes less time to move to another node.\n3. If there are no adjacent unvisited nodes at a point, then you have to traverse back to the previous node from where you came to the present node for the first time.\n4. Repeat the above process till all the nodes are visited.\n\n```\n\nNinja is provided with the time between two connected nodes, which denotes the time required to travel between two connected nodes. Ninja's task is to find the time arrival at each node for the first time.\n**Example:** ```\nLet the number of nodes be: 3\nLet there be an edge between nodes 1 and 3 and between nodes 1 and 2.\nLet the time required to reach from node 1 to 3 be 2 units and node 1 to 2 be 4 units.\nLet the weights of each node be: [0, 1, 1]\nThe graph for above will be:\n\n```\n\n![](https://files.codingninjas.in/g1-13265.PNG)\n```\nWe start from node 1. Its adjacent nodes are: {2, 3} out of which both nodes have the same weights, but the time needed to reach node 3 is less so we first move to node 3, so the first arrival time at node 3 will be 2 units.\nWe then move to node 3 whose adjacent nodes are: {1} which is already visited.\nWe move back to node 1, which takes 2 units of time. 2 + 2 = 4 units.\nWe then move to node 2 from node 1, which takes 4 + 4 = 8 units.\nHence the answer is [0, 8, 2].\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format :** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer ‘T’, the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, ‘N’ and ‘M’, representing the number of nodes and, number of edges, respectively.\nEach test case’s next ‘M’ lines contain two single space-separated integers, ‘X', 'Y', and ‘D’, which signifies an edge between ‘X’ and ‘Y’, and the time taken to travel between the two nodes, respectively.\nThe ‘M’ + 1 line of each test case contains ‘N’ single space-separated integers, representing the weight of each node.\n\n```\n**Output Format :** ```\nFor each test case, print 'N' space-separated integers representing the time arrival at each node for the first time.\nPrint output of each test case in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note :** ```\nYou do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints :** ```\n1 <= T <= 10\n1 <= N <= 10^3\nN - 1 <= M <= min(N* (N - 1) / 2, 10^3)\n1 <= X, Y <= N\n1 <= WEIGHT[i] <= 10^9\n1 <= D <= 10^6\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1 :\n```\n1\n4 4\n1 2 4\n1 4 5\n1 3 2\n3 4 3\n0 1 3 4\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1 :\n```\n0 20 8 5 \n\n```\n\n##### Explanation For Sample Input 1 :\n```\nThe graph for the test case will be:\n\n```\n\n![](https://files.codingninjas.in/g2-13266.PNG)\n```\nWe start from node 1. Its adjacent nodes are: {2, 3, 4} out of which node 4 has maximum weight, so the first arrival time at node 4 will be 5 units (time taken to reach node 4 from node 1)\nWe then move to node 4 whose adjacent nodes are: {1, 3} out of which we have already visited node 1, so we move to node 3, so the first arrival time at node 3 will be 5 + 3 = 8 (previous time + time taken to reach node 3 from node 4).\nWe then move to node 3 whose adjacent nodes are: {1} which is already a visited node.\nWe then travel back to node 1, which takes 8 units of time. 8 + 8 = 16 units.\nWe then move to node 2 from node 1, which takes 16 + 4 = 20 units.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2 :\n```\n1\n3 2\n1 2 4\n1 3 2\n0 1 1\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2 :\n```\n0 8 2 \n\n```\n\n##### Explanation For Sample Input 2 :\n```\nThe graph for the test case will be: \n\n```\n\n![](https://files.codingninjas.in/g1-13265.PNG)\n```\nWe start from node 1.

Your take is to find out whether it is possible to divide ‘NUMS’ into increasing subsequences such that each of their lengths is at least ‘K’.\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line contains an integer ‘T’, which denotes the number of test cases to be run. Then, the ‘T’ test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two positive integers, ‘N’ denoting the size of the array ‘NUMS’ and ‘K’.\nThe second line of each test case contains ‘N’ space-separated positive integers denoting the array elements.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, print ‘YES’ if it is possible to create the required subsequences, otherwise print ‘NO’.\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou do not need to print anything.

There are ‘N’ children in the park who are standing in a straight line, and not crowding up due to COVID restrictions. You are given an array “distance” containing ‘N’ integers where “distance[i]” denotes the distance of the ith child from the gate of the park in meters. Each child stands at a different distance from the gate.\nSince Santa is still on his reindeer, he can land at any position in the park. But once he lands on the ground, he uses his feet to walk. Santa is very lazy and is requesting you to find the minimum distance he needs to travel on his feet so that he can distribute all the ‘K’ gifts to ‘K’ different children.\n**Example:** ```\nLet there be 6 children and 3 gifts. If the position of the children is [3, 6, 7, 10, 17, 25], the minimum distance Santa has to walk is 4m which can be achieved in many ways, one of them being Santa landing at the 1st child and walking till the 3rd child (distance = (6m - 3m) + (7m - 6m) = 4m).\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases to run. Then the test case follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, ‘N’ and ‘K’ denoting the number of children and number of gifts respectively.\nThe next line contains ‘N’ space-separated integers denoting the array “distance”.\n\n```\n**Output Format :** ```\nFor each test case, return an integer denoting the minimum distance Santa has to travel.\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a new line. \n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of.

Distance = (13m - 10m) + (15m - 13m) + (16m - 15m) + (18m - 16m) = 3m + 2m + 1m + 2m = 8m\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2 :\n```\n2\n3 1\n2 10 4\n2 2\n4 2\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2 :\n```\n0\n2\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nint lazySanta(vector<int> distance, int K)\n{\n// Your code goes here \n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

Tony and Thanos are fighting. Before the war, Captain Marvel secretly gave Tony a superpower that she took from the other universe. They went through some days of the war but Tony’s power was enough to fight against Thanos but not to defeat him and vice versa. So, they decided to play a number game.\nIn the game, there are two integers - ‘maximumNumber’, and ‘target’. In each turn, one player can choose an integer and add it to ‘runningTotal’. The player who makes the ‘runningTotal’ equal to or more than the ‘target’ wins.\nThe rules of the game are:\n```\n1. One can use any number between 1 and ‘maximumNumber’.\n2. One integer can’t be used more than once.\n3. The running total = 0 initially.\n4. Both players play optimally.\n\n```\n\nThanos offered Tony to make the first move and he will choose the two integers. But the avengers are not satisfied. So, all came to a conclusion that after choosing the integers if Tony is not satisfied with the two integers, he will tell Thanos to rechoose two different integers. Tony is completely exhausted but doesn’t want to lose as it can cost us the complete universe. Help Tony to figure out if he can win or not from the two integers that Thanos chose.\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer ‘T’, denoting the number of test cases. The test cases follow.\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers ‘maximumNumber’, and ‘target’, which denotes the maximum number that a player can choose, and the target number which whoever takes the running total more than the target wins.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, print 1 if it is possible to win the game with the chosen integers. Otherwise, print 0.\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou are not required to print the expected output, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:** ```\n1 <= T <= 50\n1 <= maximumNumber <= 20\n1 <= target <= 200\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1:\n```\n2\n5 2\n5 6\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1:\n```\n1\n0\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation for Sample Input 1:\n```\nIn the first test case, It’s Tony’s turn, he can choose any number between 1 and 5. Initially runningTotal = 0. He will choose any number between 2 and 5 and win the game. So, the output is 1.\nIn the second test case, Initially runningTotal = 0. It’s Tony’s turn, he has to choose any number between 1 and 5. Whichever number he will choose runningTotal will lie in the range 1 to 5. In the next turn, Thanos will choose a number between 1 and 5 which Tony didn’t choose in his turn, and win the game. So, the output is 0.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2:\n```\n2\n10 15\n10 22\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2:\n```\n1\n0\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nbool makeTonyWin(int maximumNumber, int target) {\n// Write your code here.\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

You need to find the number of k-element subsequences of the given array where the bitwise AND of the subsequence's elements is maximal. Also, find the maximal AND value.\nExample:\n```\nLet the array be [1, 3, 6, 7] and K=3. The possible k-element subsequences of the given array are: {1, 3, 6}, {1, 3, 7}, {1, 6, 7}, {3, 6, 7}. Applying AND operation on all possible subsequences we get values: 0, 1, 0, 2 respectively. The maximal AND value of these subsequences is 2, and only 1 subsequence {3, 6, 7} has this value.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input format:** ```\nThe very first line of input contains an integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases. \nThe first line of every test case contains two space-separated integers ‘N’ and ‘K’ denoting the number of elements present in the array and the length of the subsequences.\nThe second line of every test case contains ‘N’ space-separated integers denoting the elements present in the array.\n\n```\n**Output format:** ```\nFor each test case, two space-separated integers are printed denoting the maximal AND value and the number of subsequences having maximal AND value, respectively.\nOutput for each test case is printed on a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nThe number of possible k-element subsequences having that maximal AND value can be very large. So, print the answer modulo 1000000007.\nYou do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just return an array of size two where the 1st element is max AND value and 2nd element is the number of subsequences having this maximal AND value. \n\n```\n\n**Constraints:** ```\n1 <= T <= 10\n2 <= N <= 5 * 10^4\n2 <= K <= N\n0 <= Arr[i] <= 10^8\nWhere ‘T’ represents the number of test cases, ‘N’ represents the number of elements present in the array and ‘K’ represents the length of the subsequences.\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1:\n```\n2\n4 3\n1 3 6 7\n3 2\n9 9 9  \n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1:\n```\n2 1\n9 3\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation 1:\n```\nFor the first test case refer to the example explained above.\nFor the second test case we have, array: [9, 9, 9], N = 3 and K = 2. The possible k-element subsequences of the given array are: {9, 9}, {9, 9}, {9, 9}. Applying AND operation on all possible subsequences we get values: 9, 9, 9 respectively.

The day in Ayush’s world has 100^100 seconds. There are some rules that are followed by Ayush while studying.\n1. He reads the chapter in a sequential order, i.e. he studies i+1th chapter only after he studies ith chapter.\n2. If he starts some chapter on a particular day he completes it that day itself.\n3. He wants to distribute his workload over 'N' days, so he wants to minimize the maximum amount of time he studies in a day.\nYour task is to find out the minimal value of the maximum amount of time for which Ayush studies in a day, in order to complete all the 'M' chapters in no more than 'N' days.\nFor example\n```\nif Ayush want to study 6 chapters in 3 days and the time that each chapter requires is as follows:\nChapter 1 = 30\nChapter 2 = 20\nChapter 3 = 10\nChapter 4 = 40\nChapter 5 = 5\nChapter 6 = 45\nThen he will study the chapters in the following order \n| day 1 : 1 , 2 | day 2 : 3 , 4 | day 3 : 5 , 6 |\nHere we can see that he study chapters in sequential order and the maximum time to study on a day is 50, which is the minimum possible in this case.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of the input contains a single positive integer 'T', denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated positive integers 'N' and 'M', denoting the number of days he can study before the ninja test and the number of chapters he has to study for the ninja test respectively.\nThe second line of each test case contains 'M' space-separated positive integers, where the ith integer denotes the time required to study the ith chapter.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case print a single line containing a single integer denoting the maximum time Ayush studies in a day.\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou don't have to print anything, it has already been taken care of.

You need to find an array of size 2*N that satisfies the following two conditions.\n1. All numbers from 1 to N should appear exactly twice in the array.\n2. The distance between the second occurrence and the first occurrence of any number should exactly be equal to the value of that number.\nThe distance between two numbers at indices ‘i’ and ‘j’ is defined as (j-i-1) where i < j.\nIf no such array exists, then you should return an empty array.\n**For example :** ```\nFor N = 3 one valid array is [3,1,2,1,3,2].\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format :** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer ‘T’, denoting the number of test cases. The test cases follow.\nThe first and the only line of each test case contains a single integer ‘N’.\n\n```\n**Output Format :** ```\nThe checker will print “Valid” if the returned permutation is valid and follows all the conditions, otherwise, it will print “Invalid”.

Here, the indices of ‘1’ are 1 and 3, and there is exactly 1 number between them, the indices of ‘2’ are 2 and 5, and there are exactly 2 numbers between them, the indices of ‘3’ are 0 and 4, and there are exactly 3 numbers between them.\nAnother possible array is [2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3]. In this permutation, the indices of ‘1’ are 2 and 4 and there is exactly one number between them, the indices of ‘2’ are 0 and 3, and there are exactly two numbers between them, the indices of ‘3’ are 1 and 5, and there are exactly three numbers between them. \n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2 :\n```\n1  \n4\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2 :\n```\nValid\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nvector<int> findPermutation(int N)\n{\n// Write your code here\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

In the city, the happiness of each person is represented as a number ‘H’ where ‘H’ ranges from -20,000,000 to 20,000,000 (both inclusive). The happiness of each person in the city is given in an array/list ‘HAPPINESS’ where ‘HAPPINESS[i]’ represents the happiness of the i’th person.\nNinja wants to make a group of people such that the overall happiness of the group (sum of happiness value of all the people in the group) ranges between ‘A’ and ‘B’ where -500,000,000 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 500,000,000. Ninja wants to know in how many ways he can make this group.\n**For example :** ```\nFor the given ‘HAPPINESS[]’ = ‘[-1, 0, 3]’ and ‘A’ = 0 , ‘B’ = 2. Following are the ways to group people such that the overall happiness of the group is between ‘A’ and ‘B’:\n[-1, 0, 3], the sum of all the happiness values of this group is 2.\n[-1, 3], the sum of all the happiness values of this group is 2.\n[0], the sum of all the happiness values of this group is 0.\n[ ], the sum of all the happiness values of this empty group is 0.\nSo the number of ways is 4.\n\n```\n\nAs Ninja is busy with some other task so he asks you for help. Can you help Ninja to find out the number of ways in which he can pick groups so that the overall happiness of the group must be in the range between ‘A’ and ‘B’?\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format :** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer ‘T’ which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains three single space-separated integers ‘N’, ’A’, and ‘B’ representing the number of elements in the array/list ‘HAPPINESS’ and the range in which happiness values of groups must reside respectively.\nThe next line of each test case contains ‘N’ single space-separated integers denoting the ‘HAPPINESS’ values.\n\n```\n**Output Format :** ```\nFor each test case, print the number of ways to pick groups so that the overall happiness of the group lies between ‘A’ and ‘B’ inclusive.\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints :** ```\n1 <= ‘T’ <= 100\n1 <= ‘N’ <= 34\n-20,000,000 ≤ ‘HAPPINESS[i]’ ≤ 20,000,000\n-500,000,000 ≤ ‘A’ ≤ ‘B’ ≤ 500,000,000\nTime Limit: 1 second\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1 :\n```\n2\n2 1 1 \n1 2\n3 -1 1\n-1 1 2\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1 :\n```\n1\n5\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation For Sample Output 1 :\n```\nFor sample test case 1 : \nGiven ‘HAPPINESS[]’ = [1,2] , and ‘A’, and ‘B’ are 1 and 1 respectively. Following are all the possible groups with their overall happiness value:\n1. [1, 2], where the overall happiness value is 3.\n2. [1], where the overall happiness value is 1.\n3. [2], where the overall happiness value is 2.\n4. [ ], where the overall happiness value is 0.\nAs we can see, there is only 1 way to make a group in which overall happiness value lies between 1 and 1 inclusive that is [1].\n\nFor sample test case 2 : \nGiven ‘HAPPINESS[]’ = [-1,1,2] ,‘A’, and ‘B’ are -1 and 1 respectively. Following are all the possible groups with their overall happiness value:\n1. [-1], where the overall happiness value is -1.\n2. [1], where the overall happiness value is 1.\n3. [2], where the overall happiness value is 2.\n4. [-1,1], where the overall happiness value is 0.\n5. [-1,2], where the overall happiness value is 1.\n6. [1,2], where the overall happiness value is 3.\n7. [-1,1,2], where the overall happiness value is 0.\nAs we can see there are 5 ways to make a group in which overall happiness value lies between -1 and 1 inclusive and that are [-1], [1], [-1,1], [-1,2], [-1,1,2].\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2 :\n```\n2\n3 -10 10\n1 3 5\n2 -4 -1 \n2 3 \n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2 :\n```\n8\n0\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nint makeHappyGroup(vector<int> &happiness, int n, int a, int b) {\n// Write your code here.\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

But, he can’t find a suitable method to check the same. Can you help Ninja to solve this problem?\nYou are given two N-ary trees, ‘TREE _A’ and ‘TREE_ B’ having ‘N’ vertices labeled from 0 to ‘N’-1, and both the trees are rooted at node 0. Your task is to find whether the trees are mirror images of each other or not. Edges of the tree are in order from left to right.\n**For Example:** ```\nFor the given example below, the trees are mirror images of each other.\n\n```\n\n![Example](https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/asset_0000000000000543_1637495553_nary.PNG)\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of the input contains an integer, 'T,’ denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer, the ‘N’ denoting the number of vertices in both the trees.\nNext, ‘N’-1 lines have two integers i,j, denoting an edge between vertex i and vertex j in ‘TREE_A’.\nNext, ‘N’-1 lines have two integers i,j, denoting an edge between vertex i and vertex j in ‘TREE_B’.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, print ‘YES’ if both the trees are mirror images of each other.\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou do not need to print anything.

Whenever a new page is referred to and is not present in memory, the page fault occurs, and the Operating System replaces one of the existing pages with a newly needed page.\nYou have given a sequence of pages in an array ‘Pages’ of length **_‘N’_** and memory capacity **_‘C’_**. You have to find the number of page faults using the Least Recently Used (LRU) Algorithm.

You find all the subsequences of size ‘K’ from the array ‘A’. Now for each of the subsequences, you calculate the product of all elements except the minimum element and the maximum element of the subsequence. After that you need to calculate the product of all these values.\nOutput the final product calculated by Ninja.

You are given an array ‘POINTS’ containing ‘N’ such points. Ninja lives at the location ‘POINTS[0]’ and wants to visit all the remaining ‘N-1’ points in the order given by the ‘POINTS’ array. Your task is to help ninja find the minimum time (in seconds) required to visit all the points in the given order (starting from ‘POINTS[0]’).\n#####  The ninja can travel according to the following rules : \n  * In one second, the ninja can either:\n    * Move vertically by one unit, i.e., along the y-direction.\n    * Move horizontally by one unit, i.e., along the x-direction.\n    * Move diagonally by ‘sqrt(2)’ units, i.e., move one unit horizontally then one unit vertically.\n  * The ninja must visit the points in the exact order as they are given the ‘POINTS’ array.\n  * The ninja is allowed to pass through points that may be given later in the order, but these points will not be counted as visited.\n\n\n**For Example :** ```\n‘POINTS = [ [3, 1], [-1, 3], [2, 0] ]’, ‘N = 3’\n\n```\n\n![Example](https://files.codingninjas.in/example-9466.png)\n```\nThe path with minimum time is: ‘[3,1] -> [2,2] -> [1,3] - > [0,3] -> [-1,3] -> [0,2] -> [1,1] -> [2,0]’.\nTime taken from [3,1] to [-1,3] = 4 seconds.\nTime taken from [-1,3] to [2,0] = 3 seconds.\nTotal time = 7 seconds.

The nodes are numbered 1 to ‘N’.\nYou need to find the ‘next’ node that is immediately right in the level order form for each node in the given tree.\nNote :\n```\n1. A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which nodes at all levels except the last level have two children and nodes at the last level have 0 children.\n2. Node ‘U’ is said to be the next node of ‘V’ if and only if ‘U’ is just next to ‘V’ in tree representation.\n3. Particularly root node and rightmost nodes have ‘next’ node equal to ‘Null’ \n4. Each node of the binary tree has three-pointers, ‘left’, ‘right’, and ‘next’. Here ‘left’ and ‘right’ are the children of node and ‘next’ is one extra pointer that we need to update.\n\n```\n\nFor Example :\n![1](https://files.codingninjas.in/1-8373.png)\nThe‘next’ node for ‘1’ is ‘Null’, ‘2’ has ‘next’ node ‘6’, ‘5’ has ‘next’ node ‘3’, For the rest of the nodes check below.\n![1](https://files.codingninjas.in/2-8374.png)\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \nInput Format :\n```\nThe first line contains an integer 'T' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run.\nThe first line of each test case contains elements of the tree in the level order form. The line consists of values of nodes separated by a single space. In case a node is null, we take -1 in its place.\nFor example, the input for the tree is depicted in the below image.\n\n```\n\n![1](https://files.codingninjas.in/3-8375.png)\n```\n1\n2 3\n4 5 6 7\n-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n\n```\n\nExplanation :\n```\nLevel 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 1\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 1 = 2\nRight child of 1 = 3\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 4\nRight child of 2 = 5\nLeft child of 3 =6\nRight child of 3 = 7\nLevel 4 :\nAll children are ‘Null’\nThe first not-null node(of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level. The second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null(-1).\n\n```\n\nNote :\n```\nThe above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space. Hence, for the above-depicted tree, the input will be given as:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n\n```\n\nOutput Format :\n```\nFor each test case, print the tree’s level order traversal after updating ‘next’ node for each node where ‘-1’  denoting the null node. \nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n\n```\n\nNote :\n```\nYou do not need to input or print anything, and it has already been taken care of.

You need to make a maximum binary tree recursively from ‘TREE’ using the following conditions:\n```\n1. Create a root of the maximum binary tree whose value is the maximum value present in the ‘TREE’.\n2. Recursively build the left subtree on the subarray prefix to the left of the maximum value.\n3. Recursively build the right subtree on the subarray suffix to the right of the maximum value.\n\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\nFor ‘TREE’ = [6, 1, 8, 2, 5],see the maximum binary tree in the below picture for reference:\n\n```\n\n![img](https://files.codingninjas.in/tree1-8450.jpg)\n```\nAs we can see the root of the maximum binary tree as shown in the picture is ‘8’ which is the maximum value in the ‘TREE’. The left subtree contains all the values which are present in the left of 8 in ‘TREE’ and the right subtree contains all the values which are present in the right of ‘8’ in ‘TREE’. Similarly, the maximum value in the left subarray of 8 is 6 so 6 becomes the root of the left subtree, 5 is the maximum value in the right subarray of the 8 so 5 becomes the root of the right subarray, and so on. \n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer 'T' representing the number of test cases.

These stones are numbered with some value and in the form of an array. He is allowed to jump either odd-numbered jumps or even-numbered jumps and has to reach the last stone.\nSo your task is to find the number of starting index from which he may start jumping so he reaches the last stones. You are provided with the given array and you have to find the number of starting index of the array from which Ninja can reach the end of the array by jumping some number of times.\nFor jumping you have to follow below instructions:\nYou may jump forward from index ‘i’ to index ‘j’ (with i < j) in the following way:\nDuring odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index ‘j’ such that ‘arr[i] <= arr[j]’ and ‘arr[j]’ is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices ‘j’, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.\nDuring even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index ‘j’ such that ‘arr[i] >= arr[j]’ and ‘arr[j]’ is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices ‘j’, you can only jump to the smallest such index ‘j’.\nIt may be the case that for some index ‘i’, there are no legal jumps.\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \nInput Format:\n```\nThe first line contains an integer 'T' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer ‘N’ denoting the size of the ‘arr’ array.\nThe next line contains ‘N’ space-separated integers denoting the values of elements of the ‘arr’ array.\n\n```\n\nOutput Format:\n```\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the number of starting indices, from where Ninja can reach the end by following the required jump conditions.\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n\n```\n\nNote :\n```\nYou do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n\n```\n\nConstraints:\n```\n1 <= T <= 5\n1 <= N <= 5000\n0 <= arr[i] < 10 ^ 6\nWhere ‘T’ is the number of test cases, ‘N’ is the size of an array, and ‘arr[i]’ represents the elements of the array.\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n\n#### Sample Input 1:\n```\n2\n5\n20 23 22 24 25\n5\n5 6 4 4 7\n\n```\n\n#### Sample Output 1:\n```\n2\n3\n\n```\n\n#### Explanation for sample input 1:\n```\nTest Case 1:\nFor the first test case, if we start from index i = 0, we can make our first jump to i = 2, since it is smaller than all other array values but then we cannot jump anymore. \nIf we start from the index i = 1, or i = 2 we can make the first jump to i = 3 then we cannot jump anymore.\nIf we start from index i = 3 we have to make only one jump and we reach the end.\nAnd if we start from index i = 4 we are already at the end.\nSo we return ‘2’ as our answer as there are ‘2’ good starting index.\nTest Case 2:\nFor the test case if we start From starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3\nFrom starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\nFrom starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.\nFrom starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\nFrom starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.\nIn total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of jumps so we return ‘3’ as our answer.\n\n```\n\n#### Sample Input 2:\n```\n1\n5\n5 1 3 4 2\n\n```\n\n#### Sample Output 2:\n```\n3\n\n```\n\n#### Explanation of sample input 2:\n```\nAs we can reach the end by starting from index 1, 2, 4\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nint ninjaJump(vector<int> &x,int n)\n{\n// Write your code here.\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

The graph is given in as an array of ‘edges’, where ‘edges[i] = [u, v, sz]’ means there is an edge between node ‘u’ and ‘v’ in the given graph. Create a new graph by replacing the edge between ‘u’ and ‘v’ with a chain of size ‘sz’.\nTo create a chain of size ‘sz’ between nodes ‘(u, v)’, create ‘sz’ new nodes and ‘sz + 1’ new edges. The new nodes are ‘X1, X2, … , Xsz’ and the new edges are ‘(u, X1), (X1, X2), (X2, X3), … , (X(sz-1), Xsz), (Xsz, v)’.\nA node is reachable from node ‘0’ if it’s at a distance of less than or equal to ‘m’ edges.

A sequence of ‘N’ integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to ‘N’ exactly once. Your task is to rearrange the numbers and generate the lexicographically next greater permutation.\nTo determine which of the two permutations is lexicographically smaller, we compare their first elements of both permutations. If they are equal — compare the second, and so on. If we have two permutations X and Y, then X is lexicographically smaller if X[i] < Y[i], where ‘i’ is the first index in which the permutations X and Y differ.\nFor example, [2, 1, 3, 4] is lexicographically smaller than [2, 1, 4, 3].\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line contains a single integer ‘T’ representing the number of test cases. \nThe first line of each test case will contain an integer ‘N’ representing the length of the permutation.\nThe second line contains ‘N’ space-separated integers which are the elements of the permutation.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, print the elements of the lexicographically next greater permutation with a single space-separated.

For example, “LISTEN” and “SILENT” are anagrams.\n\n```\n**For Example :** ```\nConsider ‘STRS’ = [“code”, “doce”, ”code”, “ceod”, “eodc”, “edoc”, “odce”].  \nThere are 2 Similar String Groups in ‘STRS’ -:\n1. “code”, “code”, “doce“, “odce”, eodc”, “edoc”\n2. “ceod”\nThus, we should return 2 in this case.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format :** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases. then ‘T’ test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case consists of a single integer ‘N’ representing the size of the list/array ‘STRS’.\nThe second line of each test case consists of ‘N’ single space-separated strings representing strings in list/array ‘STRS’.\n\n```\n**Output Format :** ```\nFor each test case, print a single integer representing the number of Similar String Groups in ‘STRS’. \nPrint output of each test case in a separate line.\n\n```\n\nNote :\n```\nYou do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.

Let ‘i’, ’j’ denote the row and column of the matrix, respectively. If ‘MAT’[i][j] is equal to 0, flip every 1 in the ‘i’th row and ‘j’th column i.e., in the same row and the column as 0.\nYour task is to return the total number of flips done over all the elements of the matrix.\n**Note:** ```\n1. Each element in the matrix 'MAT' is either a ‘0’ or ‘1.’\n2. The flip operation is performed only for the 0s in the original matrix, and not for the new 0s formed as a result of flipping 1s in the original matrix.\n3. If a cell is already flipped, don’t flip it twice.\n4. Return the minimum number of flips needed.\n\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\nLet the matrix be:\n\n```\n\n![insert eg 1](https://files.codingninjas.in/eg-6366.jpg)\n```\nThen we return 6. As shown in the figure, the cells marked in red will be counted as they lie in the same row or column as 0 and will be flipped.\n\n```\n\n![insert eg 2](https://files.codingninjas.in/eg2-6365.jpg)\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input format:** ```\nThe first line of input contains ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains ‘N’ denoting the dimensions of the ‘N * N’ matrix.\nThe next ‘N’ lines contain ‘N’ single space-separated integers denoting the matrix 'MAT’.\n\n```\n**Output format:** ```\nFor each test case, print a single line that contains an integer that denotes the total number of flips made.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou don't have to print the output it has been taken care of.

We can clearly see that there are 3 1s in the 0th row and 3 1s in the 1st column. Hence for the ‘0’ at ‘MAT’[0][1] we make 3 + 3 = 6 flips.\nWe mark the already counted cells red so we don’t count them twice.\n\n```\n\n![insert eg-2](https://files.codingninjas.in/save-2-6370.jpg)\n```\nNow we encounter the next zero at ‘MAT’[2][1]. We flip the bits in the first column which are unflipped and are 1 i.e ‘MAT’[2][2] and also the 1s which are unflipped in the second row i.e ‘MAT’[1][0] and ‘MAT’[1][3].\nFinally, the count is 6 + 3 = 9, as shown with the cells marked in red.\n\n```\n\n![insert eg-3](https://files.codingninjas.in/save3correct-6369.jpg)\n```\nNow the last cell which is ‘0’ i.e ‘MAT’[3][2]. We check for all the cells in the third row and second column and mark all the 1s which are not marked red and increment the count.\nFinally, we will have the following matrix.\n\n```\n\n![insert eg 4](https://files.codingninjas.in/save4-6368.jpg)\n```\nWe see that there are 11 cells marked red which indicate that we flipped 11 cells so we return 11.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2:\n```\n2\n5\n1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 1\n6\n0 1 1 1 1 1 \n1 1 0 0 0 1 \n0 0 1 0 1 1 \n0 1 0 0 1 0 \n1 0 1 0 1 1 \n1 0 0 0 1 1 \n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2:\n```\n16\n20 \n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nint countFlip(vector<vector<int>> &mat)\n{\n// Write your code here.\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

Being a newbie, she made a mistake and swap two nodes of the Binary Search Tree.\nYour responsibility being an expert and a good friend is to correct the Binary Search Tree made by Ninja and recover the correct Binary Search Tree.\nA binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree data structure with the following properties.\n```\n• The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with data less than the node’s data.\n• The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with data greater than the node’s data.\n• Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.\n\n```\n**Example**\n![](https://files.codingninjas.in/graph-3-8457.png)\n```\nThis is the binary search tree made by Ninja. But here, the left node of 8 is greater, and the right node is smaller.\nIf we swap the right and the left node of 8 Ninja’s Binary Search Tree will become correct.\n\n```\n\n![](https://files.codingninjas.in/graph-2-8458.png)\n```\nThis is the correct binary Search Tree.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format** ```\nThe first line contains an Integer 'T' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains the elements of the tree in the level order form separated by a single space.\nIf any node does not have a left or right child, take -1 in its place. Refer to the example below.\n\n```\n**Example** ```\nElements are in the level order form. The input consists of values of nodes separated by a single space in a single line. In case a node is null, we take -1 in its place.\nFor example, the input for the tree depicted in the below image would be :\n\n```\n\n![](https://files.codingninjas.in/graph-4-8466.png)\n```\n1\n2 3\n4 -1 5 6\n-1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1\n-1 -1\nExplanation :\nLevel 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 1\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 1 = 2\nRight child of 1 = 3\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 4\nRight child of 2 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 3 = 5\nRight child of 3 = 6\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 4 = null (-1)\nRight child of 4 = 7\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 6 = null (-1)\nRight child of 6 = null (-1)\nLevel 5 :\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\nThe first not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level. The second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null (-1).\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nThe above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space. Hence, for the above-depicted tree, the input will be given as:\n1 2 3 4 -1 5 6 -1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, print the recovered correct Binary Search Tree in level order form.\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:** ```\n1 <= T <= 100\n2 <= N <= 5000\n0 <= X <= 2^31 - 1\nWhere 'N' is the number of nodes in the BST and 'X' is the value at the node.\nTime limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1:\n```\n1\n1 3 -1 -1 2 -1 -1\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1:\n```\n3 1 -1 -1 2 -1 -1\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation Of Sample Input 1:\n```\nTest case 1:\n\n```\n\n![](https://files.codingninjas.in/graph-6-8464.png)\n```\nHere the highlighted nodes are swapped as 3 is the left child of 1, which can’t be greater than 1.\nHence if we swap 1 and 3, we can recover Ninja’s BST.\n\n```\n\n![](https://files.codingninjas.in/graph-5-8461.png)\n```\nHence our answer will be 3 1 -1 -1 2 -1 -1.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2:\n```\n1\n3 1 4 -1 -1 2 -1 -1\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2:\n```\n2 1 4 -1 -1 3 -1 -1\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation Of Sample Input 2:\n```\nTest case 1:\n\n```\n\n![](https://files.codingninjas.in/graph-9-8462.png)\n```\nIn this case, the highlighted nodes are swapped as the right subtree of 3 has a value smaller than 3. If we swap 3 and 2, Ninja’s BST will be correctly recovered.\n\n```\n\n![](https://files.codingninjas.in/graph-10-8463.png).\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n/************************************************************\nFollowing is the Binary Tree node structure:\nclass TreeNode {\npublic :\nint data;\nTreeNode *left;\nTreeNode *right;\nTreeNode(int data) {\nthis -> data = data;\nleft = NULL;\nright = NULL;\n}\n~TreeNode() {\nif(left){\ndelete left;\n}\nif(right){\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

Your task is to find the number of minimum distance paths from START to END using the transitions explained above.\nThe distance between two words is the number of transitions used to go from one word to another.\nFor example:\n```\nSTART = “cow” END = “mot”\nWORDDIC = [“cow”, “mow”, “cot”, “mot”]\nHere answer is 2 there are two paths of distance 2 ,\n“cow” -> “mow” -> “mot” \n“cow” -> “cot” -> “mot”\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer 'T' denoting the number of test cases to run. Then the test case follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated words START and END. \nThe second line of each test case contains a single integer ‘N’, denoting the length of WORDDIC.\nThe third line of each test case contains ‘N’ space-separated words, denoting the elements of WORDDIC.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case print a single integer denoting the number of paths from START to END.\nOutput for each test case is printed in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou don’t need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:** ```\n1 <= T <= 10\n1 <= N <= 5000 \n1 <= len(WORD) <= 10\nWhere ‘N’ is the length of WORDDIC, len(WORD) is the length of START, END, and words in WORDDIC.

You need to find the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements of the array equal. You can perform addition, multiplication, subtraction or division with any element on an array element.\nAddition, Subtraction, Multiplication or Division on any element of the array will be considered as a single operation.\nExample:\n```\nIf the given array is [1,2,3] then the answer would be 2. One of the ways to make all the elements of the given array equal is by adding 1 to the array element with value 1 and subtracting 1 from the array element with value 3. So that final array would become [2,2,2]. \n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of input contains a single integer 'T', representing the number of test cases.\nThe first line of input contains an integer 'N' representing the length of the array.\nThe second line contains 'N' single space-separated integers representing elements of the array 'ARR'.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, return an integer in a single line i.e. the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements of the array equal.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou are not required to print the expected output, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:** ```\n1 <= T <= 10\n1 <= N <= 10^5\n0 <= ARR[i] <= 10^5\nWhere 'ARR[i]' is the element of the array 'ARR' at index 'i'.\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1:\n```\n1\n4\n1 2 3 4\n1\n5\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1:\n```\n3\n0\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation for Sample Output 1:\n```\nIn test case 1, There can be many ways by which we can convert the array elements equal, one of the way is:\n1 + 2 = 3\n2 + 1 = 3\n4 - 1 = 3\nHere the first operand is the element of the array and the second operand is the operation that we did for making all the numbers of the array equal.\nHence, we did 3 operations to change the elements of the array to 3. Hence the answer is 3.\nIn test case 2, There is only 1 element and hence no need to make equal and so answer is 0.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2:\n```\n2\n3\n2 4 2\n5\n1 2 1 4 1\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2:\n```\n1\n2\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation for Input 2:\n```\nIn test case 1, by dividing 4 by 2 (i.e. 4 / 2) we can have all the elements equal to 2. Thus only 1 operation is performed and so answer is 1.\nIn test case 2, There can be many ways by which we can convert the array elements equal, one of the way is:\n2 / 2 = 1\n4 / 4 = 1\nHere the first operand is the elements of the array and the second operand is the operation that we did for making all the numbers of the array equal.\nHence, we did 2 operations to change the elements of the array to 2. Hence the answer is 2.\n\n```\n\nJavascript (node v10.20.0) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n/* Declare and implement your function here \neg: function example(parameter_name1,parameter_name2....){}\nHandle the input/output from main()\n*/\nprocess.stdin.resume();\nprocess.stdin.setEncoding('ascii');\nvar input_stdin = \"\";\nvar input_stdin_array = \"\";\nvar input_currentline = 0;\nprocess.stdin.on('data', function (data) {\ninput_stdin += data;\n});\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

You need to find all such nodes which have a distance K from the given node and return the list of these nodes.\nDistance between two nodes in a binary tree is defined as the number of connections/edges in the path between the two nodes.\nNote:\n```\n1. A binary tree is a tree in which each node has at most two children. \n2. The given tree will be non-empty.\n3. The given tree can have multiple nodes with the same value.\n4. If there are no nodes in the tree which are at distance = K from the given node, return an empty list.\n5. You can return the list of values of valid nodes in any order. For example if the valid nodes have values 1,2,3, then you can return {1,2,3} or {3,1,2} etc.\n\n```\n**Example :**\n![Sample Output 2 explanation](https://files.codingninjas.in/screenshot-from-2020-11-03-15-04-33-5636.png)\n```\nConsider this tree above. The target node is 5 and K = 3. The nodes at distance 1 from node 5 are {2}, nodes at distance 2 from node 5 are {1, 4} and nodes at distance 3 from node 5 are {6, 3}.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line will contain the values of the nodes of the tree in the level order form ( -1 for NULL node). Refer to the example below for further explanation.\nThe second line contains the value of the target node.\nThe third and the last line contains the integer K denoting the distance at which nodes are to be found. \nExample:\nConsider the binary tree:\n\n```\n\n![Input Format Fig.](https://files.codingninjas.in/screenshot-from-2020-11-03-14-34-55-5635.png)\n```\nThe input for the tree depicted in the above image would be :\n3\n5 1\n6 2 0 8\n-1 -1 7 4 -1 -1 -1 -1\n-1 -1 -1 -1\nExplanation :\nLevel 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 3\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 3 = 5\nRight child of 3 = 1\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 5 = 6\nRight child of 5 = 2\nLeft child of 1 = 0\nRight child of 1 = 8\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 6 = null (-1)\nRight child of 6 = null(-1)\nLeft child of 2 = 7\nRight child of 2 = 4\nLeft child of 0 = null (-1)\nRight child of 0 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 8 = null (-1)\nRight child of 8 = null (-1)\nLevel 5 :\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 4 = null (-1)\nRight child of 4 = null (-1)\nThe first not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level.

Sort the Linked List using merge sort.\nMerge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. The merge() function is used for merging two halves. The merge(arr, L, M, R) is a key process that assumes that arr[L..M] and arr[M + 1...R] are sorted and merges the two sorted subarrays into one.\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T, representing the number of test cases or queries to be run. \nThen the T test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains the elements of the singly linked list separated by a single space and terminated by -1.

You need to implement the following things as follows:\n```\n1. BSTIterator(Node root) - It is a parameterized constructor in which you are given the root of the Binary search tree. It will be called whenever an object of BSTIterator is created.\n2. next() - This member function will return the next smallest element in the in-order traversal of the binary search tree. You need to implement this function.\n3. hasNext() - This function will return true if there exists the next smallest element in the traversal else it will return false. You need to implement this function\n\n```\n\nThe binary search tree has ‘N’ nodes you need to print the inorder traversal of the tree using the iterator.\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of the input contains an integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first and the only line of each test case contains elements of the tree in the level order form. The line consists of values of nodes separated by a single space. In case a node is null, we take -1 in its place.\nFor example, the input for the tree depicted in the below image would be :\n\n```\n\n![image](https://files.codingninjas.in/bsttominheap-6482.jpg)\n```\n4\n2 6\n1 3 5 7\n-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n\n```\n\nExplanation :\n```\nLevel 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 4\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 4 = 2\nRight child of 4 = 6\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 1\nRight child of 2 = 3\nLeft child of 6 = 5\nRight child of 6 = 7\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 1 = null (-1)\nRight child of 1 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 3 = null (-1)\nRight child of 3 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\nThe first not-null node(of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level. The second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null(-1).\n\n```\n**Note :** ```\nThe above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree.\nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space. Hence, for the above-depicted tree, the input will be given as:\n4 2 6 1 3 5 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nThe single line of output for each test case should contain the inorder traversal of the binary search tree.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.

A valid transaction involves buying a stock and then selling it.\n**Note** ```\nYou can’t engage in multiple transactions simultaneously, i.e. you must sell the stock before rebuying it.\n\n```\n**For Example** ```\nInput: N = 6 , PRICES = [3, 2, 6, 5, 0, 3] and K = 2.\nOutput: 7\nExplanation : The optimal way to get maximum profit is to buy the stock on day 2(price = 2) and sell it on day 3(price = 6) and rebuy it on day 5(price = 0) and sell it on day 6(price = 3). The maximum profit will be (6 - 2) + (3 - 0) = 7.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer 'T' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two single-space separated integers ‘N’ and ‘K’, respectively.\nThe second line of each test case contains ‘N’ single space-separated integers, denoting the elements of the array 'PRICES'.\n\n```\n**Output Format** ```\nFor each test case, print a single integer denoting the maximum profit in at most K transactions.\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note** ```\nYou do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of.

The optimal way to get maximum profit is to make only 1 transaction, i.e., buy the stock on day 3 (price = 1) and sell it on day 5(price = 10). The profit will be 10 - 1 = 9.\nTest Case 2: In the second test case, we can make a maximum of 2 transactions. The optimal way to get maximum profit is to make 0 transactions because the price of stock is continuously decreasing and we will have a loss if we buy and sell the stock.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2\n```\n2\n4 0\n2 6 5 2\n4 2\n1 2 3 5\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2\n```\n0\n4\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nint maximumProfit(vector<int> &prices, int n, int k)\n{\n// Write your code here.\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

You don’t need to return ‘K-th’ smallest node, return just value of that node. \n3. If ‘K-th’ smallest element is not present in BST then return -1.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases.\nThe next ‘T’ lines represent the ‘T’ test cases.\nThe first line of input contains a single integer ‘K’.\nThe second line of input contains the elements of the tree in the level order form separated by a single space.  \nIf any node does not have a left or right child, take -1 in its place. Refer to the example below.\nExample:\nElements are in the level order form. The input consists of values of nodes separated by a single space in a single line.

The second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null (-1).\n\n```\n**Note :** ```\nThe above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space.

Ninja decided that he will take individual entries and then will divide them into pairs. As part of the entry, he asked the participants to choose any number.\nNinja then thought of a creative method to divide them into pairs. He decided that he would select a number ‘K’, and then select numbers from the list that have a difference equal to ‘K’.\nYou need to help Ninja in finding the number of distinct pairs from the numbers with differences equal to ‘K’.\n**Example:** ```\nLet us suppose the numbers are chosen by participants: [2, 6, 5, 2, 3] and K = 3, then the distinct pairs having differences equal to K are: [2, 5] and [3, 6] so print 2. \n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nThe list of numbers can contain duplicate numbers, you need to print only the distinct pairs.\nFor example [2, 2, 3, 4] and K = 1, so you need to print 2 as the two distinct pairs are: (2, 3) and (3, 4).\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line contains a single integer ‘T’ representing the number of test cases. \nThe first line of each test case will contain two space-separated integers ‘N’ and ‘K’, where ‘N’ denotes the number of elements of the array that contains the chosen numbers, and ‘K’ denotes the difference required between the pair elements.\nThe second line of each test case will contain ‘N’ space-separated integers denoting the chosen numbers by the participants.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, print a single integer that denotes the distinct pairs having differences equal to K. \nOutput for every test case will be printed in a separate line.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:** ```\n1 <= T <= 10^2\n0 <= N <= 10^4\n0 <= K <= 10^4\n0 <= ARR[i] <= 10^9\nWhere ‘ARR[i]’ is the value of elements of the array.\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1:\n```\n2\n5 3\n2 6 5 2 3\n4 1\n1 1 2 2\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1:\n```\n2\n1\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation For Sample Input 1:\n```\nIn the first test case, \nThe distinct pairs having difference equal to 3 are (2, 5) and (3, 6)\nIn the second test case, \nThe distinct pairs having a difference equal to 1 is (1, 2)\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2:\n```\n3\n3 2\n2 6 4\n3 1\n1 2 4\n6 1\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2:\n```\n2\n1\n5\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation For Sample Input 2:\n```\nIn the first test case, \nThe distinct pairs having difference equal to 2 are (2, 4) and (4, 6)\nIn the second test case, \nThe distinct pairs having a difference equal to 1 is (1, 2)\nIn the third test case, \nThe distinct pairs having difference equal to 1 are (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5) and (5, 6)\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nint kDiffPairs(vector < int > & arr, int n, int k) {\n// Write your code here.\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

He thought of some ‘M’ numbers and an integer ‘D’. He wants to know who many numbers among these ‘M’ random numbers will satisfy the following equation:\n```\nLet the random number be ‘X’\n| X- ARR[i] | > ‘D’ for ‘i’ in range 0 to length of ‘ARR’-1.   \n\n```\n\nYou are given an ‘ARR’ array having ‘N’ numbers, another array ‘B’ having ‘M’ numbers, and integer ‘D’. Your task is to find the count of numbers among array ‘B’ satisfying the given condition.\n**For Example** ```\nFor the given ‘ARR’ = [ 13,1,4 ] and B=[7,6,9] and ‘D’=3, the answer will be 1 as only 9 satisfies the given condition among the given numbers.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of the input contains an integer, 'T,’ denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers, 'N’ denoting the number of numbers in array ‘ARR’, ‘M’ representing the number of elements in array ‘B’, and integer ‘D’.\nThe second line contains ‘N’ numbers denoting the numbers in the array ‘ARR’.\nThe third line contains ‘M’ numbers denoting the numbers in array ‘B’.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, print a single integer denoting the count of numbers among array ‘B’ satisfying the given condition. \nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou do not need to print anything.

So 2 doesn’t satisfy the given condition.\nThe absolute difference between 1 and all elements of ‘ARR’ is greater than ‘D’.So 1 satisfies the given condition.\nThe absolute difference between 8 and all elements of ‘ARR’ is greater than 1. So 8 satisfies the condition.\nSo there are 2 numbers among ‘B’ which follows the condition. Hence the answer is 2.\nFor the second test case:\nThe absolute difference between 7 and 4 is 3, which is not greater than 3. So 7 doesn’t satisfy the condition.\nThe absolute difference between 6 and 4 is 2, which is not greater than 3. So 6 doesn’t fulfill the condition.\nThe absolute difference between 9 and all elements of ‘ARR’ is greater than 3. So 9 satisfies the given condition.\nSo there is only 1 number among ‘B’, which follows the condition. Hence the answer is 1.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2:\n```\n2\n3 3 2\n8 4 5 \n3 10 6\n5 3 3\n10 12 0 8 0 \n4 3 8\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2:\n```\n0\n1\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\nint countOfConstraints(int n, int m, int d, vector<int> &arr, vector<int> &b)\n{\n// Write your code here.\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

But due to some error in the security, some of the files got infected by a virus. Given two strings ‘A’ and ‘B’ and a virus string ‘C’, Your task is to tell the number of files that are not affected by the virus. An unaffected file follows the given conditions:\n```\nThe name of the file should be greater than or equal to the string ‘A’.\nThe name of the file should be less than or equal to string ‘B’.\nThe name of the file should not contain the virus string as a substring ‘C’.\nSince the answer can be very large, print answer % (10^9 + 7).\n\n```\n**For Example** ```\nIf N=2 and string ‘A’ = “bc” and string ‘B’ = “bm” and virus string ‘C’ = ”g”.So the files that are not affected are “bc”, “bd”, “be”, “bf”, “bh”, “bi”, “bj”, “bk”, “bl”.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of the input contains an integer, 'T,’ denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer, 'N’, denoting the length of the file’s name.\nThe second line contains three strings corresponding to ‘A’, ’B’ and ‘C’.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, print an integer corresponding to the number of unaffected files % (10^9 +7). \nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou do not need to print anything.

Each cell of the box may contain:\n```\n1) A fixed obstacle denoted by ‘ * ’\n2) A stone denotes by ‘ # ’\n3) Empty space denoted by ‘ . ’\n\n```\n\nInitially the box is placed on the ground and due to gravity all the stones lie either on the lowest cells in their column, or a stone may be supported by another stone or by the fixed obstacle beneath it.\nYou now rotate the box 90 degrees clockwise, so its height becomes ‘M’ and its width becomes ‘N’, re-aligning all of the stones. But as stated previously, the obstacles are fixed and won’t change their relative positions. You have to find the new alignment of the box after the rotation.\n**Note :** ```\nYou may consider the stones to be heavy and rotational force has no effect on them. That is: the stones do not re-align themselves during the rotation. \n\n```\n**For Example :** ```\nIf N = 1 and M = 6 and box is:\n‘#’ , ‘.’ , ‘.’ , ‘*’ , ‘#’ , ‘.’ \nThe box after rotation becomes:\n ‘.’\n ‘.’ \n ‘#’\n ‘*’\n ‘.’ \n ‘#’ \n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format :** ```\nThe first line contains a single integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases, then each test case follows:\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers ‘N’ and ‘M’ denoting the dimensions of the box initially.\nThe next ‘N’ lines each contain ‘M’ characters denoting the cell of the box.\n\n```\n**Output Format :** ```\nFor each test case, print the box after re-aligning, the new box is of dimensions M*N.\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note :** ```\nYou are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of.

By reading all these strings, Ninja thought of a ‘TARGET’ string in his mind and wanted to form this target string using these ‘N’ strings. The formation of the string should follow the following conditions:\n```\n1. The indices of characters in the order in which they are used should form a strictly increasing order.\n2. You can use multiple characters from one string.\n\n```\n\nYour task is to find the total number of ways in which the ‘TARGET’ string can be formed. Two ways are said to be different if the sequence of indices is different or the sequence is the same but chosen from different strings. The number of ways can be very large so return its mod 10^9 + 7.\n**For Example** ```\nFor the given ‘WORDS’ = [ \"acca\",\"bbbb\",\"caca\" ], and ‘TARGET’ = \"aba\".\nThere are 6 ways to form the ‘TARGET’ string.\n\"aba\" -> index 0 (\"acca\"), index 1 (\"bbbb\"), index 3 (\"caca\")\n\"aba\" -> index 0 (\"acca\"), index 2 (\"bbbb\"), index 3 (\"caca\")\n\"aba\" -> index 0 (\"acca\"), index 1 (\"bbbb\"), index 3 (\"acca\")\n\"aba\" -> index 0 (\"acca\"), index 2 (\"bbbb\"), index 3 (\"acca\")\n\"aba\" -> index 1 (\"caca\"), index 2 (\"bbbb\"), index 3 (\"acca\")\n\"aba\" -> index 1 (\"caca\"), index 2 (\"bbbb\"), index 3 (\"caca\")\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of the input contains an integer, 'T,’ denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer, 'N’, denoting the number of strings in the ‘WORDS’ array.\nThe second line contains ‘N’ strings denoting the ‘N’ strings found in the book.\nThe third line contains the ‘TARGET’ string.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, print an integer corresponding to the number of ways to form the ‘TARGET’ string % (10^9 +7). \nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:** ```\n1 <= T <= 10\n1 <= N <= 1000.\n1 <= length of strings in ‘WORDS’ array<=1000.\n1 <= length of ‘TARGET’ string <= length of WORDS[i] . \nTime limit: 1 sec\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1:\n```\n2\n3\nadc\naec \nefg\nac \n3\nacca\nbbbb\ncaca\naba\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1:\n```\n4\n6\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation of sample input 1:\n```\nFor the first test case,\nThe possible ways to form the ‘TARGET’ string are:\n\"ac\" -> index 0 (\"adc\"), index 2 (\"adc\")\n\"ac\" -> index 0 (\"acca\"), index 2 (\"aec\") \n\"ac\" -> index 0 (\"aec\"), index 2 (\"adc\")\n\"ac\" -> index 0 (\"aec\"), index 2 (\"aec\")  \nHence, the answer is 4. \nFor the second test case:\nThe possible ways to form the ‘TARGET’ string are:\n\"aba\" -> index 0 (\"acca\"), index 1 (\"bbbb\"), index 3 (\"caca\")\n\"aba\" -> index 0 (\"acca\"), index 2 (\"bbbb\"), index 3 (\"caca\")\n\"aba\" -> index 0 (\"acca\"), index 1 (\"bbbb\"), index 3 (\"acca\")\n\"aba\" -> index 0 (\"acca\"), index 2 (\"bbbb\"), index 3 (\"acca\")\n\"aba\" -> index 1 (\"caca\"), index 2 (\"bbbb\"), index 3 (\"acca\")\n\"aba\" -> index 1 (\"caca\"), index 2 (\"bbbb\"), index 3 (\"caca\")\nHence, the answer is 6.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2:\n```\n2\n1\nabcd\nabcd\n2\nabba\nbaab\nbab\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2:\n```\n1\n4\n\n```\n\nC++ (g++ 5.4) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\nint ninjaAndStrings(int n, vector<string> &words, string &target)\n{\n// Write your code here.\n}\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

There are total ‘N’ cities on this island connected with ‘m’ tracks. All the cities on this island are connected to each other, directly or indirectly. Thomas and all his engine friends travel from city ‘a’ to city ‘b’ daily but might use different routes. Some of these tracks are present on all the paths from the city ‘a’ to ‘b’. Due to excessive load on these tracks, all of these tracks are not in good condition, so one day Thomas asks The Fat Controller to repair all the tracks that are present on all the paths from ‘a’ to ‘b’. Help the Fat controller to count all these tracks.\n**For Example:** ```\nn = 5, m = 5, a = 1, b = 0\n\n```\n\n![](https://files.codingninjas.in/thomas_and_friends_example-12826.png)\n```\nNow in this example, all the paths from ‘1’ to ‘0’ are:\n1 -> 4 -> 0\n1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 0\nThe track 4 -> 0 is present in both of these paths.

You have to remove an edge such that the partition is as fair as possible. In a fair partition, the difference between the assets of the children should be as small as possible.\nReturn the minimum possible difference between the asset values of the children after partition.\n**For Example :** ```\nIf N = 5 and Assets = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 } and tree is denoted as:\n\n```\n\n![](https://files.codingninjas.in/pp-img-12927.jpg)\n```\nThen we have 4 choices of deletion:\nEdge 0-1 is deleted: now, the one of the tree contains node-1 and node-3, and the other contains node-0, node-2 and node-3, subtree difference is = 90 - 60 = 30\nEdge 1-3 is deleted: subtree difference is = 110 - 40 = 70\nEdge 0-2 is deleted: subtree difference is = 80 - 70 = 10\nEdge 2-4 is deleted: subtree difference is = 100 - 50 = 50\n\nClearly removing the edge between node-0 and node-2 leads to the most optimal partition where the difference is equal to 10.

The frog wants to reach the 'Nth' stair. 'HEIGHT[i]' is the height of the '(i+1)th' stair.If Frog jumps from 'ith' to 'jth' stair, the energy lost in the jump is given by absolute value of ( HEIGHT[i-1] - HEIGHT[j-1] ). If the Frog is on 'ith' staircase, he can jump either to '(i+1)th' stair or to '(i+2)th' stair. Your task is to find the minimum total energy used by the frog to reach from '1st' stair to 'Nth' stair.\n**For Example** ```\nIf the given ‘HEIGHT’ array is [10,20,30,10], the answer 20 as the frog can jump from 1st stair to 2nd stair (|20-10| = 10 energy lost) and then a jump from 2nd stair to last stair (|10-20| = 10 energy lost). So, the total energy lost is 20.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of the input contains an integer, 'T,’ denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer,' N’, denoting the number of stairs in the staircase,\nThe next line contains ‘HEIGHT’ array.\n\n```\n**Output Format:** ```\nFor each test case, return an integer corresponding to the minimum energy lost to reach the last stair.\n\n```\n**Note:** ```\nYou do not need to print anything.

It is Christmas eve, and Santa wants to give gifts and chocolates to the kids who live in the building which is present at the cell (N - 1, M - 1). Initially, Santa is present on cell (0, 0). Since Santa is in a hurry, help him find a path from starting point to the endpoint with the least amount of time.\nThe Santa may go only from one building to any of its adjacent buildings which is present either to the right or to the bottom or bottom right cell i.e. if the current position is (x, y), he may go to (x + 1, y + 1) or (x + 1, y) or (x, y + 1) given that the new coordinates are in the grid. The time taken to reach from one building to another is equal to the absolute difference between the heights of buildings.\nNote:\n```\n1. The heights of the buildings are positive.\n2.

Your task is to find all the starting indices of PTR’s anagram in STR.\nAn anagram of a string is another string which contains the same characters and is obtained by rearranging the characters.\nFor example: ‘SILENT’ and ‘LISTEN’ are anagrams of each other. ‘ABA’ and ‘ABB’ are not anagram because we can’t convert ‘ABA’ to ‘ABB’ by rearranging the characters of particular strings.\nNote:\n```\n1. Both STR and PTR consist of English uppercase letters.\n2. Length of string 'STR' will always be greater than or equal to the length of string ‘PTR’.\n3. In case, there is no anagram substring, then return an empty sequence.\n4. In case of more than one anagrams, return the indices in increasing order.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer 'T' representing the number of test cases or queries to be processed. Then the test case follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers ‘N’ and ‘M’ where ‘N’ denotes the number of characters in 'STR', and ‘M’ denotes the number of characters in ‘PTR’.\nThe second line of each test case contains the string 'STR'. \nThe third line of each test case contains the string ‘PTR’. \n\n```\n**Output Format :** ```\nFor each test case, print a sequence of all the starting indices of the anagram substrings present in the given string 'STR'.\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note :** ```\nYou do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:** ```\n1 <= T <= 100\n1 <= N <= 10^5\n1 <= M <= N\nTime limit: 1 second\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 1 :\n```\n2\n10 3\nCBAEBABACD\nABC\n5 2\nABADE\nBA\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 1 :\n```\n0 6\n0 1\n\n```\n\n##### Explanation For Sample Output 1:\n```\nTest Case 1:\n'STR' is ‘CBAEBABACD’ and ‘PTR’ is ‘ABC’.\n0-2 in 'STR' index 0,1,2 are ‘CBA’, and it is an anagram with ‘ABC’.\n1-3 in 'STR' index 1,2,3 are ‘BAE’, and it is not anagram with ‘ABC’.\n2-4 in 'STR' index 2,3,4 are ‘AEB’, and it is not anagram with ‘ABC’.\n3-5 in 'STR' index 3,4,5 are ‘EBA’, and it is not anagram with ‘ABC’.\n4-6 in 'STR' index 4,5,6 are ‘BAB’, and it is not anagram with ‘ABC’.\n5-7 in 'STR' index 5,6,7 are ‘ABA’, and it is not anagram with ‘ABC’.\n6-8 in 'STR' index 6,7,8 are ‘BAC’, and it is an anagram with ‘ABC’.\n7-9 in 'STR' index 7,8,9 are ‘ACD’, and it is not anagram with ‘ABC’.\nHence, there are only two substrings in the given string 'STR' that are anagram with given string ‘PTR’ which are ‘CBA’, and ‘BAC’ and starting indices of respective anagram substrings are 0 and 6.\n\nTest case 2:\n'STR' is ‘ABADE’ and ‘PTR’ is ‘BA’.\nIn the given string ‘ABADE’ the substring of length 2 starting with index 0 is ‘AB’ which is an anagram with the string ‘BA’ and a substring of length 2 starting with index 1 is ‘BA’ which is also an anagram with the string ‘BA’. Because 0 and 1 are starting indices of the substrings, we print 0 and 1.\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Input 2:\n```\n2\n10 4\nBACDGABCDA\nABCD\n7 1\nABABABA\nA\n\n```\n\n##### Sample Output 2:\n```\n0 5 6\n0 2 4 6\n\n```\n\nJavascript (node v10.20.0) \n![Full screen](https://static.naukimg.com/code360/assets/icons/controlled-timer.svg)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n/* Declare and implement your function here \neg: function example(parameter_name1,parameter_name2....){}\nHandle the input/output from main()\n*/\nprocess.stdin.resume();\nprocess.stdin.setEncoding('ascii');\nvar input_stdin = \"\";\nvar input_stdin_array = \"\";\nvar input_currentline = 0;\nprocess.stdin.on('data', function (data) {\ninput_stdin += data;\n});\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\nConsole \nPrev \nRun  Submit code \nNext \nSettings\nReset Code\nLayouts\nFull Screen Mode\nStart timer\n",

Your task is to find the largest number, ‘K’, such that both the values ‘K’ and -‘K’ are present in the given array 'arr'. If no such number exists, then return '-1'.\n**For example:** ```\nConsider ‘arr’ = [1,2,-2,-1], the largest value of ‘K’ is 2, since a negative of 2 is also present in the array. Hence, the answer is 2.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format :** ```\nThe first line contains a single integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases, then each test case follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer ‘N’, denoting the number of elements in the array.\nThe second line of each test case contains ‘N’ space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array.\n\n```\n**Output Format :** ```\n For each test case, print the largest number, ‘K’, such that -’K’ is also present in the array.\nThe output for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n\n```\n**Note :** ```\nYou are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of.

The bride and groom want everybody to play a game and thus, they have blindfolded the attendees. The people from the bride’s side are holding odd numbers and people from the groom’s side are holding the even numbers. For the game to start quickly, all the bride’s side people should come first, followed by the groom’s side people in the same order.\nThe attendees of the wedding with their numbers are given in the form of a Singly Linked List, arranged randomly.\nA singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional; that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail).\n**Example:** ```\nThe attendees holding numbers from 1, 4, 3 are shown: \n\n```\n\n![](https://files.codingninjas.in/oddeven-6399.png)\nAs the organizers are busy, you have to arrange all the people by arranging the bride’s side people first followed by the groom’s side people sequentially.\n**Note:** ```\nFor the above example 1 -> 4 -> 3, 1 -> 3 -> 4 is the only correct answer, i.e nodes should be grouped sequentially.

You need to delete the node with value 'K'. It is guaranteed that a node has the value 'K'.\nA binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those in its right subtree.\n**Note:** ```\nAll the elements of the binary search tree are unique.\n\n```\n\nDetailed explanation  ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) \n**Input Format:** ```\nThe first line of input contains an integer 'T', the number of test cases.\nThe first line of every test case contains elements in the level order form. The input consists of values of nodes separated by a single space in a single line. In case a node is null, we take -1 on its place.\nThe second line of every test case contains a single integer 'K' denoting the value of the node to be deleted. It is guaranteed that this value exists in the Binary Tree.\nFor example, the input for the tree depicted in the below image would be :\n\n```\n\n![alt txt](https://files.codingninjas.in/unnamed-4-6332.png)\n```\n20 10 35 5 15 30 42 -1 -1 -1 13 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 \n\n```\n\nExplanation :\n```\nLevel 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 20\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 20 = 10\nRight child of 20 = 35\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 10 = 5\nRight child of 10 = 15\nLeft child of 35 = 30\nRight child of 35 = 42\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 15 = null (-1)\nRight child of 15 = 13\nLeft child of 30 = null (-1)\nRight child of 30 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 42 = null (-1)\nRight child of 42 = null (-1)\nLevel 5 :\nLeft child of 13 = null (-1)\nRight child of 13 = null (-1)\nThe first not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level. \nThe second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null (-1).\n\n```\n\nNote :\n```\nThe above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space.
